Hey shubudha! What happened I see you are not able to sync your lips properly and that’s
why your expression are not good Actually the problem is I don’t know Punjabi and I don’t
know the lyrics and its meaning so if you can help me with the lyrics then I can sync my lips
according to it I hope that won’t be a much trouble for you No that is not a trouble for me; I
will just write a programme and let you know the lyrics Oh! Programme that’s awesome
Yeah I can write the programme for this yeah sure then you give me then I will by heart the
lyrics ok perfect
Hey everyone as you saw shubudha struggling with the lyrics of the Punjabi song Here I am
to help her through python through coding You must be surprise how can we do it In python
there are many state of the art technologies one of them is speech recognition speech
recognition is an apn that has been provided to us by goggle In this particular library it will
just convert the audio file that you supply to text it will convert the audio file to text so it will
be easier for shubudha to by heart the lyrics then and improve on her dancing skills So first
of all how can you install it Yes you first need to install it you just use the command sudo
pip install speech recognition you just go to your terminal and type sudo pip install speech
recognition it will ask you the password and then it will be downloaded to your pc so it is
very easy to install this particular library that is speech recognition You just need to type on
your terminal sudo pip install speech recognition and then there are many steps involved here
to I will just you to create the audio file with the help of your microphone as I did just now
As I am Punjabi I know Punjabi so I just spoked the words of the song in microphone and
recorded the file then I converted that particular file to dot wav extension yes whatever you
record whatever you need to convert to text u need to convert that particular audio file to dot
wav extension I repeat this is very necessary speech recognition only works on dot wav
extension files you must have recorded the files and it maybe in dot wp4 and any other
extension but if it is not on wav extension you need to convert it into wav extension so first of
all you have to create and audio file with the help of your microphone and then you need to
convert it into wav extension Wav extension your audio file can be convert it into wav
extension online there are many sources that are readily available you can easily convert
your audio file into wav extension so basically what’s steps are involved here first of all you
have to install speech recognition I repeat you have to install speech recognition with this
particular command that is pip install speech recognition after that you have to create an
audio file with the help of your microphone Whatever you need to convert it to text and then
you have to convert this particular audio file to dot wav extension these are the three steps
that are involved here first of all you need to do these three steps and then you will program
So let us do this three steps and program Hey everyone I am done with the steps I first
installed speech recognition then recorded to the file through micro phone and then converted
the audio file into dot wav extension so these are the steps I have asked you to do I hope you
have done with the steps since you are all done with the steps let us start with the programme
So first of all you need to import speech and recognition that you have installed say it is
basically import speech underscore recognition as sr you can use a name sr or you can just go
with speech recognition it’s your wish So first of all I create a variable name audio file that I
will assign to my audio file so my audio file is sample underscore simran dot wav speech
note the fact speech recognition only recognises dot wav file so you have to convert your
audio file to your dot wav then it will basically use audio file as the audio source you the
audio file as the source then you have to initialise the recogniser sr dot recogniser it will
basically initialise the recogniser after that what you have to do is with sr dot audio file
because you are using audio file here what name has been assigned to your audio file mine is
audio underscore file we will use it as source what you have to do here is audio is equal to r
dot record source so this function will basically read your audio file reads the audio file So
now what we have to do now here is we have to write try print audio file contains r dot
recognise underscore goggle audio it will basically print the text print the text that is there in
your audio file it will convert your spoken words to text except sr dot unknown value error
you must be wondering what I am doing here here basically it will raise an exception sr dot
unknown value error in case it is not able to understand the audio you will have to raise the
exception here in case your goggle speech recognition module is not able to understand your
audio file so I will write here print Google speech recognition could not understand audio
you are also have to write another exception that is except sr dot request error this will be
this will occur if the we are not able to get the results from Google speech recognition so you
will write here couldn’t get the results from Google speech recognition so I use the word here
exception instead of error please note the fact that exception is a type of error I repeat
exception is a type of error so as you saw we first use the audio file as the source then we
initialise the recogniser and then we read the audio file after that will Google speech
recognition will basically recognise your audio file and convert it into text and in case it is
not able to do that it will raise two exceptions it can raise two exceptions first of all is if it is
not able to understand the audio and second one is if it is not able to get the result from
Google speech recognition so we are done with the programme here let us try to run this
programme and check whether I will be able to help shubudha or not let us try to check that
Yes we have the audio file here; audio file contains that particular song and let me check that
yes! That is right isn’t it amazing! We can just record our audio file and convert it into text so
I am very happy I can help shubudha and I think she can by heart the lyrics and improve on
her dancing skills I think so So as you saw speech recognition is a state if the art technology
that has been provided to us by the Google through python so you can use this and convert
your audio files to text it is very very easy through python so thank you I hope this
programme is very useful to you and have a nice day happy learning Hey you are eating
something No nothing Something there on your mouth nothing is that chocolate Yeah hey
you are eating chocolate yeah show show show this is almost over wait I have one chocolate
I will give you guys would you guys please share that No no no no I want one chocolate I
won’t share with you I want no no last time also you took last time also you took no I want
no I want I won’t share I will not share please share it please share it hey wait wait wait
wait see I have an idea let us play a game ok if you are lucky if you win the game you will
get the chocolate are you ok for this deal Ok I will play the game anyways I will win I will
not share with you we will see we will see will see will see let’s play the game yeah will see
so as I have said I have hidden my chocolates in one of this three bags you are suppose to
guess where would I have hidden what would you like to choose Hmmm I will choose this
bag this is your choice among the three bags let me make your life simpler I will open this
bag this is empty so the chocolate must be present in one of this two bags would you like to
retain your choice or you would like to swap No no no you are just tricking me this is my
final choice I will stay with this this is your final choice then I will close this ok now your
turn is over I will call shubudha after her turn I will announce the results ok shubudha come
as I have said I have one chocolate I have hidden it in one of these three bags you are suppose
to guess which bag I would have hidden so which one you would like to choose Out of three
I have to choose one yeah I will choose this bag this is your choice yeah among three yes
let me make your life simpler I will open this bag this is empty so chocolate must be present
in one of these two bags would you still like to retain this choice of yours or you would like
to swap Oh this seems to be an interesting strategy let me think I think I will swap I will
swap this will be my final choice Ok shubudha your turn is over you had chosen that bag
has your final choice yes I will close this and I will call amit and will see the results ok amit
come ok You had chosen this bag to be your final choice this contains this is empty oh god
and shubudha you had actually made a swap when I gave you a chance yes you initially
choose this and you choose this let me open simultaneously this is your final choice so let us
zoom into this this contains the chocolate and you win the chocolate this is yours thank you
I won can you please give me a bite no no no we had decided that we will not waste at least
half half no no I will not share one fourth at least no no no no I will not share Ok so we saw
that the mother is playing trick on the kid she is trying to force him to swap force him to
change the decision the point is is it really required what exactly is happening here I am
sure we all are confused right So let me do one thing in the beginning of the video beginning
of this lesson you saw three people playing a game right The chocolate game and vidya takes
them and makes them play a game while she puts a chocolate inside a bag and the point is to
find out what is that bag which has the chocolate ok and amit actually loses the game correct
Let me now call amit and ask him this question why exactly he lost the game Was it out of
shear bad luck or was it because his strategy wasn’t correct HI amit hello sir I saw the game
that you played it was interesting I am just wondering if you understood the nit critics of the
game the game is not simple as it appear to you right so what just happened in the game
vidya tempted you people to play the game to win the chocolate correct As she was smart
she said she opened up a new bag which did not have a chocolate and tempted you to change;
you did not change while shubudha changed right You lost shubudha won my question is did
shubudha get lucky here and did you get unlucky Or if you are given a second chance should
you swap Or should you not swap What do you have to say Sir I don’t think it matters
because in the end I have to choose one cup out of three yeah so why does it matter that I
have to swap My chances are same looks like it correct yeah out of three I have to choose
one in the end I don’t think it make any difference I don’t know I think it was just a luck
yeah so you know life is full of deceptions we think we think this is not the right way to do
but that will be the right way to do sometimes we feel that this is the right way to do and we
will end up realising that this is not the right way to do here is one such lesson of life where I
am going to show to you that swapping has a huge upper hand over not swapping by that I
mean when vidya tricks you you should succumb to the trick temptation of changing if you
decide to always change your mind you have higher chances of winning the chocolate shall
we see how Sure Have this three cups with me one two and three perfect as an example I
don’t have chocolates I don’t have jar so we should adjust with this I need something to ok
correct this will be the chocolate alright I am going to hide this some where you are not
going to say it right This is the chocolate three glasses alright Ok Turn that side you do not
know where the chocolate is ok there are two glasses where there are no chocolate and there
is a glass with a chocolate let say ok so let me clear my table so that it is visible to you right
amit No chocolate one chocolate here start I have to choose yeah two glasses do not have
chocolate one glass has a chocolate; hmm I will choose middle one middle one Yes it
doesn’t have a chocolate you choose middle one touch the middle one; this was your choice
correct You choose this yeah but then I am going to show you that this doesn’t have a
chocolate and now I am going to throw this away from the scene now you are left with two
choices this or this If you want you can change your mind change your mind and choose this
or don’t change your mind and stick to this what would you like to do I will not change my
mind ok the point is the same right Yes sir changing mind or not changing the mind doesn’t
matter right You are not changing your mind you lost its luck na Its luck yeah so what if
this had instead of this this had it you would have won exactly correct again you got
unlucky right so we will do one thing ok why don’t we repeat this experiment let say some
fifty times ok as long as it is possible for us Sure you do one thing you stick to only on
strategy hmmm you say sir I will not swap come what may use that strategy some thirty
times ok ok and then the next thirty games will be you will always swap whenever I say
whenever I show you an empty jar like this you will say I am sorry whenever you show an
empty jar like this you will say sir I choose this but I plan to swap ok change sure thirty this
way thirty that way let see how it goes ok we will make a note of how many times you win
in the previous in the first strategy and then see how many times amit wins in the second
strategy and let us decide for others which is the better method Now we all have a feeling
that it doesn’t matter what strategy you choose you win or lose with the same chance the
chances of winning or losing is a same or may be not will see this in detail with this
experiment Isn’t this counter institutive We thought both seemed a like you see amit told me
that how does it matter it looks like in both the cases I am choosing something my chances of
winning should not change but our quick experiment that I did with amit I was making him
turn that side and I was trying to play the game with him he won more number of times in the
second case where he was swapping right he was winning less in the first case where he was
not swapping see if we play the game once we can probably say oh I lost because of bad luck
we played the game many a times if you observed we played the game twenty times each for
this strategy and this strategy somehow the second strategy of swapping seem to have an
upper hand why So now the question is how do I even experiment and decide that one
strategy is indeed better than the other Computation to our rescue lets see
So first of all let me give you a brief introduction of what Monte hall problem is all about in
Monte hall problem we have three doors two of them comprises of goods and one of them
comprises of a price say bmw in this whole programme screen cast we will be using bmw as
the price So in Monte hall problem participant is asked to choose any one of this doors after
he or she had made his or her choice the host ask the participant to change his choice what
the host basically does here is he opens a particular door out of these three doors ok now we
are left with only two doors one that has been chosen by the participant and one that has been
opened yet so now the host ask the participant to change his choice it depends on the
participant to swap or not swap his or her choice now what the participant do here is should
he swap or not swap this is the question that we should answer ok so this seems question will
be exploring will be answering in the programming screen cast will have a kind of setup here
in which we have three doors two of them comprise of goods and one of them comprise of
bmw after the choice whether the participant swapped or not swapped we will we will try to
explore this fact that what is the optimal strategy here whether the participant should swap or
not swap Let us try to explore this fact so let us start with the programming screen cast of
Monte hall As I said we need three doors here so I will be taking a list here namely doors ok
this is the list doors I will be taking another list here called goat door that will keep a track of
the door that comprise of goats After that I will be taking two variables swap and don’t swap
this will take care of the fact of number of swap wins and number of don’t swap wins swap
will basically keep a track of number of swap wins and just I will write here number of swap
wins and don’t swap will keep a track of number of don’t swap wins don’t swap wins ok now
that we are done with it we will generate a random number here that will keep a track of what
particular door will comprise of bmw So since we are given only three doors here we will
call them zeroth door first door and second door so we have to generate a random number
here random dot randint from zero to two ok so either any of these three doors will comprise
of bmw so I will just write here ‘x’ will comprise ‘xth’ door will comprise of bmw ok now
that we are done with it after that I will just write doors x will comprise of bmw yes we are
done with it now now the rest of the doors should comprise of goats now I will just do that
here I in range just write zero to three since this will take into count that this is zero one and
two so if I here is equal to is equal to ‘x’ then to continue ok continue what does continue
what does continue do here what purpose does it serve here if I write continue then it will go
to the start of the loop if I write continue it will go to the start of the loop since the ‘xth’ door
is already comprise of the bmw we only need to take into the count the doors except ‘x’ so if I
equal to is equal to x here it will again go to the start of loop and implement i because we are
not considering x here we are only considering the doors that comprise of goat else what we
are going to do here else will just see doors of I it will comprise of goat so you just write goat
here one thing we have to do here we have to append goat door also here goat door dot
append and particular index that is I here so we are done with the doors two of them
comprises of goat and one of them comprises of bmw after that we have to make the user
input its choice so let us do that choice is equal to int enter your choice after that int input you
just write int input that will make the user input his or her choice now we have to we also
now that user has made his choice now the host will ask the user about swap or not to swap
but before that he will open a door so door open will take a variable here door open I will
again generate it randomly here so I will write random dot choice goat door now please note
this fact that we can only open the door that comprise of a goat we can only open the door
that comprise of a goat so we are only considering goat door here I hope that you are familiar
here with random dot choice we have already explained it so goat door is a list here from
which from which it choice from which a door will be will be taken randomly so here we are
we have to open the door only comprise of goat so I will write here open a door that
comprises of goat Ok now that we have opened the door after that what we have to do here is
we also need to take care of this fact in mind that the choice and the door open should be
same here for example if the participant has made a choice of a door that comprises of a goat
and we are also opening that particular door please note the fact that this is not allowed here
so we need to also take care of this fact that choice and the door open shouldn’t be same so I
will just have a while loop here while door is equal to is equal to choice I will again and again
choose randomly from the list goat door so I will just write door open is equal to random dot
choice goat door you just need to write here I will write the comment here door open
shouldn’t be equal to choice made by the participant ok so we have also done that after that
we have to give a choice to the user whether he or she wants to swap or not so you just write
swap int input we don’t need to write int here you just write input do you want to swap He or
she will answer in y or no or in y or n ok so done that after that you have to apply a if loop
here so just write if ch is the choice made by the participant yes then it will be y then what
you have to do here is if doors choice is equal to is equal to goat that means he made a choice
of door that comprised of goat at initial stage then he will win here print player wins ok and
you have to increment swap variable here else what you have to do is else print player lost I
will again explain the if else loop here what we are doing here is if ch is equal to is equal to y
that means the player has chosen to swap if he has chosen to swap then we have to we have to
take care of the fact that if he has chosen goat in initial stage in initial choice then if he swaps
here then obviously he will get a bmw because already a door comprising of goat has been
opened and a door that has goat he has chosen in its initial stage and now he is swapping now
if he will swap he will get bmw ok so he is winning through swap so we will increment the
swap variable here else if he has chosen bmw at his first place and now he is swapping
obviously he is going to lose this game so now we are done with if ch is equal to is equal to y
and if he doesn’t chose to swap here what will he do here If he doesn’t chose to swap here
will write if doors choice is equal to is equal to goat If his choice was goat initially then and
he doesn’t chose to swap to then he is bound to lose the game so you will just write print
player lost done else if he didn’t chose goat at his first place then he will win because he has
chosen bmw in at in his initial choice so just write print player wins Ok and now he has won
because he hasn’t swap so you have to increment the don’t swap variable here so just
increment the don’t swap is equal to don’t swap plus one After that you have to print this
number of swap and don’t swap wins so let us try to run this programme so just save it
Monte hall dot sorry so let us try to run this programme again there is some error here I will
just show you it is saying random is not defined because we haven’t imported the library
random so you just write import random list index out of range it is giving us an error list
index out of range so how can you handle that Let me think about it we can easily handle
that I think we need to initialised the list here we just initialise it with zero ok since we are
only using three doors here multiplied it by three also initialise this particular list here that is
goat door so you write zero here and multiplied with by two so again run it name door is not
defined so it is basically doors not door let me check if I have used it in some other place no
so let us try to run it again enter your choice so you have to enter your choice from of your
door choice it can be zero one or two so I will enter zero do you want to swap I will choose
swap so player wins ok now the player has won because he has swap again I will run it
enter your choice I will enter two here do you want to swap No Player wins also here so
again run enter your choice I will enter two do you want to swap Yes I want to swap the
player lost because he or she swapped again run one do you want to swap Yes Player wins
again enter your choice Two No the player lost so how can we keep a track of this how can
we find out the what is the optimal strategy here I am really confused so what I will do here
is I will run this programme again and again for example ten times and then try to find out
what are the number of swap wins and number of don’t swap wins here so that I will just take
a variable here so I will just take a variable for example I took j j is equal to zero and I have
while loop here while j is less than ten I will run ten times for that you have to indent it
properly so indent it properly so since we have to run it ten times so I will just use a while
loop here for that you have to indent it properly ok so now this has to go here this has to go
here this here now it has to be inside the while loop after that the choice thing will also inside
the loop so you just write choice here this if loop was inside this if loop so this is nested
basically this else is for the above if please indent it properly I will request you otherwise you
will get an error after that this else so for the above if ok now that we are done with it So let
us try to run it Enter your choice zero Do you want to swap Yes Enter your choice two
Do you want to swap Yes Enter your choice one Do you want to swap No Two swap yes
One swap yes So it is going on and on I think I didn’t I think we didn’t increment the j point
j variable here yes you need to increment the j variable here so just write j is equal to j plus
one so that it just run for definite number of times ok so I will just do that ok we have exhibit
it now let us try to run it again so that we can get what is optimal strategy here Enter your
choice zero Do you want to swap Yes Player wins do you want to swap No Do you want
enter your choice two Do you want to swap Yes One Do you want to swap No Zero do
you want to swap Yes Enter your choice two Do you want to swap No Enter your choice
two Do you want to swap Yes Enter your choice one Do you want to swap Yes Enter
your choice one Do you want to swap Yes Enter your choice zero Do you want to swap
Yes So here number of swap wins as you can see is five and number of don’t swap wins is
one so is swapping is the optimal strategy here Do you really think so Is swapping the
optimal strategy here Let us try to run this once again and try to find out what is the optimal
strategy so let us try to do that again here zero Do you want to swap Yes One no two Do
you want to swap No One no Two yes Zero yes Two yes One no Zero no One yes
So here also number of swap wins are greater than number of don’t swap wins so I will run it
once again so has to get the clear cut idea of what is happening here Enter your choice zero
Do you want to swap Yes Player lost one Do you want to swap Yes Two Do you want to
swap Yes One Do you want to swap Yes Two Do you want to swap Yes Enter your
choice one Do you want to swap Yes Zero do you want to swap No Two no One no
Zero no So number of swap and number of don’t swap wins are equal here so we are getting
difference distribution but in every case that we have run here number of swap wins are either
greater than number of don’t swap wins or they are equal to number of don’t swap wins So
we can say that we are not sure of this fact that we will always win if we swap but there is
higher probability of you winning if you swap Yes this seems right from the programme that
we are doing here number of swap wins are always greater than equal to number of don’t
swap wins so we can say that there is higher probability of you winning if you swap and there
is lower probability of winning if you don’t swap so now that we are done with the
programme we will just go through the programme once again so what we are really doing
here is first of all you have to make two list first one is doors and second one is goat door we
are taking only three doors here zeroth door first door and second door and we have two
goat doors here two of them comprise of goats and one of them comprise of bmw next what
we are doing here is we are taking the track of number of swap wins and number of don’t
swap wins through these variables after that we will have a while loop while we are using a
while loop here because we need to keep a track of number of swap wins and number of
don’t swap wins ok so I am running this programme ten times you can run it fifty times
hundred times and check what is the optimal strategy According to me it is number of swap
wins it is swapping strategy and it will work in your case too please check it after that and
taking the variable ‘x’ here this particular door except door will comprise of bmw then we are
using a for loop here because the rest of the doors would comprise of goats except door
comprises of bmw and rest of the doors comprises of goat now what we are doing here is we
are using a new key word here continue why I am using here because except door already
comprises of bmw and if I is equal to is equal to ‘x’ here then we have to continue we have
to bring the control of the programme to the start of the loop because we are not considering
‘x’ here we are considering list of the doors here and else if I is not equal to ‘x’ then doors at I
will comprise of goat I also need to append in goat door list because that is keeping a track of
doors that is comprise of goats after that you have to enter your choice ok the choice the
participant chooses after that door open now the host will open one of the doors ok please
note this fact in mind the open door and the choice shouldn’t be equal ok they shouldn’t be
equal so we are using the while loop here so door open is equal to random choice door since
we are already using a goat door list here I will just make a choice from the list goat door ok
after that you have to make the user input whether he or she wants to swap or not ok you just
ask the user do you want to swap y or n if ch is equal to is equal to y then if he has if ch is
equal to is equal to y that means he or she wants to swap and he has made a choice of goat at
first place and if he has made a choice of goat at first place and now he is choosing to swap
then he is bound to win now he will get a bmw so in this particular case the player wins he
has won because he has chosen to swap so we will increment the number of swap wins else
he will lose the game after that if he doesn’t chose to swap and he has chosen goat in his
initial choice then he is bound to lose the game else if he has chosen bmw and he is not
interested to swap that means he is going to win the game in this particular case number of
don’t swap wins will increment it will be incremented Now since we are using while j less
than ten we are using j variable here we need to increment j here so we incremented j here
after that we are printing number of swap wins and number of don’t swap wins I hope you
understood this particular programme on Monte hall and this programming screen cast is
useful to you guys thank you happy leaning
Rock paper scissor I win rock paper scissor I win rock paper scissor draw rock paper
scissor draw hey guys what are you playing We are playing rock paper scissor ok What is
that This is scissor ok this is the paper this is the rock rock cuts the scissor the scissor cuts
the paper and paper cuts the rock the rock cuts the scissor the scissor cuts the paper and
paper cuts the rock did you get it Can you explain You will not understand please let us play
don’t waste our time don’t disturb ok please Rock paper scissor why are you cheating
Where did I cheat You changed your sign just now! No no don’t lie you show scissor then
you changed to paper! No no you are simply telling I don’t want to play with you Hey vidya
can I talk to you for few minutes Sure My friends were playing rock papers scissors game
now I understood I goggled it One of my friends were cheating I want to create the
mechanism where no one can cheat is there any way to do that Well I remember having
studied something like that oh yeah! In nptel there is a course called joy of computing in
which actually the professor teaches a mechanism through which we can play rock paper
scissors in which no one can cheat definitely you should take a look at it Oh yeah! Thanks
vidya definitely I will take a look at it
I was a ten old kid when i play a whole lot of games with my dad and dad would invariably
win be it arm wrestling or be it running dad was number one or even with indoor games such
as chess or tick tack tow anything that involved logic dad would was dad was way faster than
me there is no absolute game where i could win over him and that is when i came across this
game called the rock paper scissor where muscle power or logic had no role to play it was a
game which involved sheer luck and i was a happy kid and this game became my the
favourite Let me now tell you the rules of the game called rock paper scissors there are three
items here as i told you rock paper and a scissor the point is all these three items are equally
powerful and at the same time equally power less every single item is less powerful than
some other item and more powerful than some other item for instance a paper is less powerful
than a scissor because a scissor can cut though a paper while a paper more powerful than a
rock because it can completely cover the rock that’s the story with the paper now coming to
the rock a rock is more powerful than a scissor as you see a rock can smash the scissor while
a rock is less powerful than a paper simply because a paper can cover the rock lastly a
scissor scissor is more powerful than paper as it can cut the paper into pieces but it is less
powerful than a rock as stated already two people randomly choose an item and they choose
one of the three items rock paper or scissor the moment they choose it they declare it by
showing the symbol a close fist denotes a rock a palm for a paper and a V symbol for scissor
Once they pick they both decide which item is more powerful than the other and declare who
wins as you see there are several possibilities here there is also a possibility of draw please
note that is when both people choose the same item let me give you a few examples assume
dad chooses rock and i choose scissors obviously dad wins because a rock can beat a scissor
in case dad chooses paper and i chose scissor obviously i won because a scissor cuts the
paper and assume dad and me both ended of choosing rock we call it a draw let me
enumerate all the cases Assume dad chooses rock son also chooses rock it is a draw dad
chooses rock son chooses paper son wins dad chooses rock son chooses scissor dad wins
paper and rock dad wins paper paper obviously a draw paper and scissors son wins scissor
and rock son wins scissor and scissor a draw scissor and paper dad wins these are the only
cases you can see this is a great game to play but with time you will realise that there is room
for cheating how do we patch this up Is there a way to patch it The course is about the joy
of computing is there a solution to this problem through programming Any ideas here is a
straight forward solution this is how the interface will look like after i finish coding the first
player is asked to enter one of the three numbers zero one or two where zero stands for rock
one stand for paper two stands for scissors so firstly the son comes and enters a number and
then goes away from the place the screen is cleared and then comes dad and he enters his
choice of the number zero one two based on what is the item that he has chosen and then he
goes away from the place and both of them come together and they observe who won the
game that we both of them are committing to their item nobody can cheat here the computer
finally declares who is the winner well it’s very easy to program this but don’t you think its
cumbersome for dad and son these two players to come inside their room punching their
choice and then go out they should keep doing this a game requires both of them to come
punk and go back and then both of them to come together and then see the result looks like
this is not a feasible way of creating a good interface is there a better way Let us see Here is
a very cool way to do this dad and son they both secretly come and chose a placeholder in a
ten digit number what do i mean by this Assume these are the ten digit holders and the son
says i am going to choose the third digit which means his item is going to be hidden here and
dad comes separately and then chooses his placeholder assume he chooses the seventh digit
which means his item will be stored in the seventh digit and then now dad and son both of
them sit together dad doesn’t know son’s placeholder son doesn’t know dad’s placeholder
they both sit together and they start typing their ten digit numbers by hiding their secrets item
in their secret place holder you see the idea is cool can we make it a little cooler You see
with the lot of intelligence it looks like one person can guess what the other person is
choosing it looks like it although i am not so sure you should tell me whether with some
amount of intelligence one player can guess what the other player player secret placeholder is
so let us make this game a lot more complicated I am going to bring in two new changes to
the game so change one you are not going to assign zero one two for rock paper scissor even
that’s a secret a zero for son could be rock but zero for dad could be scissor so they input this
information secretly just the way they input their placeholder secretly and the second one
would be why take a ten digit number with entries being only zero one two let us take an
ordinary ten digit number each placeholder can be anything between zero one two three four
five six seven eight nine what i will do is i will put my secret zero one or two in my secret
placeholder and you see you can make it further complicated by increasing the number of
digits why necessarily ten digits you can make it fifteen digits or twenty digits right it
probably will become difficult for people to enter that bigger number but is till you realise
that bigger the number of digits more complicated the game becomes for the other person to
guess that is As you know rock paper scissor is a two player game so first of all let me do
this assignments for say player one and player two for player one we have zero as a rock one
as the paper and two as the scissor similarly for player two we can do the assignments but let
to we have zero as the paper one as the rock and two say as the scissor Please note that we
are using dictionaries here to do the assignments now we are done with the assignments you
can also make the user input this assignments it’s your wish completely your wish now we
have to make the user input the number and the secret bit position in the number for that I
will a while loop by true first of all let us make the user input num one that is for player one
the choice of player one input this is for player one player one enter your choice for player
two will have num two input player two enter your choice we also have to make the user
input the secret bit position for player one we have bit one int input player one enter the
secret bit position for player two we have bit two int input player two enter the secret bit
position Please observe that we are using int here for num one and num two we used only
input the default input tag in python is string but we want bit one and bit two to be integers so
we will type cast it to int next please see that this while loop will run till infinite times we
have to restrict this while loop this while loop should run till the number of times till user
wants so will have one more parameter here say ch and will make the user input this
parameter will have ch input will say do you want to continue y is for yes n is for no If ch
here is n then while break out of this while loop break now we have now we are done with
the assignments as well as input of the required parameters so next step is to quote the rules
for rock paper scissor I assume that u have watched all the videos and you know the rules of
rock paper scissor but still for the record let us revise for rock paper scissor In rock paper
scissor we have three entities one is the rock second one is the paper and third one is the
scissor we have rock paper scissor paper can cover the rock and rock can crush the scissor
and scissor can cut the paper please observe that nothing is one important here everything is
equal powerful here so let us try to code for rock paper scissor for rock paper scissor we will
have a function rock paper scissor will pass num one num two and bit one bit two next step
would be calculating two more parameters which can be calculated from num one bit one
num two bit two will calculate p one this is for player one this is basically int num one bit
one mode three what is p one here P one basically is the placeholder at bit position bit one in
num one and will mode it with three because the numbers that we are input here that we are
going to input here are basically decimal numbers but we want answer in zero one two so will
do mode three here similarly for player two we have p two in which will have int num two bit
two mode three not that we are done with calculating p one and p two you can code the rules
very easily will do if player one p one is equal to is equal to player two p two then this will be
a draw print draw then the next rule else if if player one p one is equal to is equal to player
two rock and player two p two is equal to is equal to say scissor as you know rock can crush
the scissor so player two wins here sorry player one wins here player one wins Next rule if
player one p one is equal to is equal to rock and player two p two is equal to is equal to paper
as you know rock can crush the paper cut as you know paper can cover the rock so player two
wins here Next rule player one p one is equal to is equal to paper and player two p two is
equal to is equal to scissor as you know scissor can cut the paper player two wins here print
player two wins else if player one p one is equal to is equal to paper and player two p two is
equal to is equal to rock as you know paper can cover the rock so player one wins here print
player one wins Next rule else if player one p one is equal to is equal to scissor and player
two p two is equal to is equal to rock as you know rock can crush the scissor so player two
wins here print player two wins Next rule else if player one p one is equal to is equal to
scissor and player two p two is equal to is equal to paper as you know scissor can cut the
paper so player one wins here print player one wins So now we are done with coding the
rules too we are done with the assignments we are done with the input of required parameters
and we are done with coding of rules too now so now let us call this function here will call
rock paper scissor and will pass num one num two bit one and bit two so this is done too let
us try to run this programme There is no end of literal here did let us try to run it again so
enter your choice choice is basically number here I will input a three digit number one two
three I will input three digit number here too five six seven say secret bit position for player
one zero for player two it is one it is a draw please observe that here we are input number
num one and num two are input in the form as a string so they texting will start from zero and
go till number of digits minus one I will repeat then texting will start from zero and go till
number of digits minus one ok so we will have to input the secret bit position accordingly
now let us look at the output we enter one two three and five six seven and the secret bit
positions are zero and one for player one the secret bit position is zero so it will be one for
player two secret bit position is one it is six if we mode six mode three then it will be zero
for player one we have one for player two we have zero for player one one is paper and for
player two zero is also paper so it results in a draw if you want to continue you can type y
and if you don’t you can type no will have one more example here will do five six seven eight
say and two three four let us enter the secret bit position for player one it will be two say and
for player two it will be one it again calls for a draw let us have some another example two
three four one six seven eight zero and three it is again draw One more example seven eight
nine four five six two and one player one wins so you can try it as many number of times as
you want I hope you enjoyed the programming screen cast I hope to see you again in the
next programming screen cast thank you have a nice day Hey amit sowjanya yeah hi you
are playing rock paper scissor game na yeah I will show you something read this ok Ok you
wrote a programme yeah so that is nice player one assignments player two assignments
enter the position ok enter a five digit number it looks awesome yeah I think we can go with
this way and play can we play Awesome yeah! Just two minutes enter your assignments
yeah yeah yeah what about me Enter your assignment ok yeah just give me two seconds
Now you guys can play ok! oh it’s my turn my turn yeah now I play yeah yeah oh yes see I
won ok ok let me second turn now I will wait wait no no see again I won yes oh god! Thank
you so much draw!! Did you like the game Yeah yeah yeah no one can cheat Oh! Yeah
Hey amit lets play a game what game It’s called twenty questions game what!! You have to
keep a number in your mind between say one to ten thousand ok and I will guess it right less
than twenty attempts less than twenty attempts!! Yeah I don’t think it’s possible oh it is very
easy Ok the rules goes like this I will ask whether the number is less than equal to or greater
than some number so you have to just say yes or no or it is less than or equal to or greater
than you will ask me whether my number is less than equal to greater than your some
random number yeah yeah I will say a number ok let’s try this say you keep five and will
start from one to ten one to twenty I will ask whether your number is less than ten you have
to yes then I will ask again some questions sure let’s play this yeah Yeah I will crack this in
less than twenty attempts ready Will see ok keep some number ok I have between one to ten
thousand Yeah Is your number less than five thousand or equal to five thousand or greater
than five thousand Less than five thousand Less than five thousand ok so is your number
less than two thousand five hundred equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred Less
than two thousand five hundred Less than! Cool now is it less than thousand two fifty equal
to two fifty thousand two fifty or greater than thousand two fifty Less than thousand two
fifty less than ok Again is it less than equal to greater than six twenty five Hmmm less than
Awesome I don’t think you will crack in twenty attempts ah no wait Is it less than equal to
greater than three twelve Less than three twelve Awesome less than equal to greater than
one fifty six Less than Hmmm now it’s getting closer is it less than equal to greater than
seventy eight Less than Ok less than equal to greater than thirty nine Less than thirty nine
Awesome is it less than equal to greater than nineteen Less than nineteen Is it less than
equal to greater than nine Greater than nine so it’s greater than nine is it less than equal to
greater than fourteen It’s exactly fourteen yaar! Yeah wow I cracked in eleven questions see;
exactly eleven how is it even possible What’s the logic behind this yaar That’s a good
question You saw what just happened we played a beautiful game and even we wrote a piece
of code for it Let me now bring in a small variation to the game in the variation is the
following I will tell you that I have a number in my mind and that number is less than one
lack common guess the number how this difference is this game from the previous game so
assume you keep the number six hundred in your mind I know it is less than one lack right
How do I How on earth will I guess that it’s going to be six hundred I should ask you this
question is it greater than five hundred Is it greater than ten thousand Is it greater than
twenty thousand And so on right is there a smart way of doing this Think about it I am
going to tell you something which looks like very different from the game I have been
discussing a number one to one lack guess what the number is A variant of what we did just
now right I am going to give you an example which looks very different but these two things
are the same example is that of how would you search for a word in English dictionary Let’s
say you want to see the word proclaim p r o c l a I m proclaim how will search for this in the
dictionary You will open the dictionary in the middle why middle You do not know whether
proclaim is in the first half of the dictionary or the second half of the dictionary the moment
you open the dictionary in the middle you will get words starting from ‘n’ letter ‘n’ so you
know for sure that first half of the dictionary is all those words is starting from a b c d
efghijklm n because you saw the word when you open the dictionary in the middle so your
word proclaim should be in the second half of the dictionary so what you do is you discard
the first half and only look at the second half and again go to the centre of it centre of second
half will now be let’s say ‘s’ words starting from s now what can you conclude From ‘a’ to
‘n’ was first half of the dictionary which you discarded and now when you take the midpoint
of the second half you are seeing ‘s’ which means your word proclaim should be in the first
half of this little cut down dictionary in the second half its in the first half if you know what I
mean Right Think about it every time you open the dictionary by half you are discarding
one part of it and retaining other part of it correct And so on and so forth you finally reached
the word proclaim in no time because your dictionary size is reducing by half correct What is
this to do with the problem that we were discussing Keep a number in your mind from one to
one lack and I will guess what the number is Can use the way I searched through a English
dictionary that same method here think about it it is indeed possible What you do is ok; do
you have a number in your mind Is it less than fifty thousand Or greater than fifty thousand
You see what I am doing like the dictionary I am trying to see you see this line is it on the
left side of the is it the first half of one to one lack or is it in the second half If a number is in
the first half you will say “less than fifty thousand” if your number is in the second half then
you will say “it is greater than fifty thousand” and there I am I know for sure I can now
reduce my search space by half and now I will ask you id your number less than twenty five
thousand or greater than twenty five thousand Do you see that this method is exactly the
same as searching through an English dictionary Let us now go ahead and try to write a piece
of code for this Whatever we did just now is popularly called the binary search the binary
search words look complicated but there is nothing here Binary means cutting into two
pieces and search in only one piece and continue doing it your space where you are searching
will get halved and very very very quickly note the usage of the word very very very it is
indeed so quick very very very quickly you will narrow down to your search key in no time
this is called binary search

Look at this array with thirty elements can you spot the umber eleven here Ah looks very difficult
you should look through every single element from the beginning till the end but what if this array
was sorted by sorted I mean what if this was in ascending order of the numbers don’t you think it
would have been very easy for you to search for the number eleven This is the sorted version of the
array the list; do you see eleven right now What did you just now do You used binary search to find
eleven so the moral of the story is if you want to find for an element search for an element in a list it
is easier for you if the list is sorted You see this is in general true with your life you will find what you
want if you keep your life organised if your list is organised in some ascending order if it is in
ascending order searching for an element becomes very easy you see so we have been teaching you
how to keep how to how to search for an element if the list is sorted but we dint teach you how to
sort a list let us now see how can one sort a list
HI guys in last video we saw we saw that how we can perform binary search on a list of
numbers which are sorted So we saw that the the list we provided for the function was
already sorted which means that numbers where in ascending order one two three four five
six seven eight something like that but in real world what happens that whatever you data
whatever the data you get is not is not sorted it is actually some random numbers in some
random orders and whenever you have to perform such kind of search that let’s say binary
search and then you have to sort it so sorting is the algorithm which as a lot of applications
so in this program we are going to perform such sorting algorithm known as a bubble sort it is
a very easy algorithm I will tell you how to I will tell you the exact algorithm when you can
use the algorithm to write your won program we will write the program for bubble sort also
so let’s see this let me first given an array so let us assume that we have an array of size five
and the elements are five one four two eight so what I want I want to sort the elements of this
array it means it should the final array should look like one two five four and eight so bubble
sort is like that so in first loop what I will do so I will have two loops exactly so in first
iteration what I have to do I will compare the first two elements and see whether the first
element is less than the second element are not if it is not if the first element is not less than
the second element then I will swap their positions so here five is not less than one so I will
swap so one should come before five so it will become one five now I will move to the next
two elements which are five and four so I will go there I will compare them and see the same
thing which is if five is less than four then it is ok otherwise I will swap them so five is not
less than four so I have to swap them so it will become four and five so now I will move to
the next two elements which are five two again I will perform the same I will check the same
condition so five is not less than two so I will swap them so it become two and five I will
move to the next two elements same conditions since five is less than eight so I don’t have to
swap them so my array my first loop is over I will go to the second loop and the second
iteration in second iteration again I will compare the first two elements so I am doing the
same thing so you can find the pattern here in the first loop inside the first loop I must have
another loop in that loop I should do all those things and whenever the second whenever the
first iteration of first loop gets over the second instance come I will do the second again do
the again perform the same thing so again I will perform compare the first two elements one
and four since one is less than four I don’t have to swap anything I will move to the second
two elements four is not less than two so I have to swap them so two comes before four it
becomes two four I will move to the next two elements four is less than five so I don’t have
to swap anything now next two elements less than eight I don’t have to swap anything so
after this my my array is sorted so I need the exactly something like it one two four five eight
so now you know the algorithm I give you the simple basic idea of the algorithm I am not
writing the pseudo code kind of thing you will use this idea to write the program it’s the very
simple program and I think that anyone can write it so we will see in the next video So let
me write the program for this algorithm which is bubble sort so let me write the function def
bubble and the parameter will be the array which I want to get sorted ok first let me compute
the length of this array so for length there is a function length of’ a’ it check it returns the
length of any lists which you provide there so length Len of ‘a’ will return me the length of
this array or the list so I will write my first loop which is for I in range of ten which is the
length of the array so first loop is first loop should until the number of elements in the list ok
The second loop should start from the first element but after after all the swapping see what
was happening here so after all the swapping the maximum element was going to the last
position so in the second pass we we don’t have to we don’t have to compare that element or
include that element in the comparison so we can safely exclude the last element which we
got in the last pass so every time we will exclude one such element in such way will get the
sorted array So the second loop will go for j in range it will start from zero ok but it will go
until n minus I minus one minus one is because of the range issue because we have to go
until the minus one part and minus I is that when the ith element when the maximum element
gets to its the the last position then we have to exclude that element for that I am putting
minus i so it means that when I is zero it means that it is the first iteration it means there is
no maximum element which went to the last position so we have to go to the last element in
the second loop but after the after I becomes one it means that one of the maximum element
first maximum element went to the last position when we have to exclude it so for that n
minus I is required and after this after when I becomes two it means two maximum elements
first maximum element and the second most maximum element went to the went to its correct
position it means nth position and n minus one position we have to exclude it so that s why
this condition is required Then I just have to check the condition which ever I was talking
about if a of j it means the current position is greater than a of next position which is j plus
one if such thing happens then just swap it I will create a temporary variable temp and I will
assign it the value of aj in aj I will put a of j plus one and in a of j plus one I will put the temp
variable this is just swapping of two elements that’s it that’s all my programme should be my
sorting is complete let me just create an array ‘a’ which I gave in the example of which was
five comma one comma four comma two comma eight ok this was my array I will call my
function bubble and pass this array let me print the elements of this sorted array for I in a
that’s it I will print ‘i’ great my program is complete I will just run it cool one two four five
eight so my array was five one four two eight got one two five four eight which is one two
four five eight which is sorted see you can create your own array and you can run this
programme and you will get the sorted array so this is how we perform a sort we perform
sorting this is one of the algorithm this is not the best algorithm that we have there are so
many better algorithms for example quick sort merge sort heap sort and so other sorting
algorithms but this is the basic algorithm which you guys can use if you if you do not know
much about sorting and after you learn more of the programming and algorithm and data
structures related things then you can go on to the more advanced sorting algorithms so that
your time it takes your function takes less amount of time in order to sort an array thank you
You saw how you can sort a list in fact you can sort it with an in build function python function as
well but we taught you just for completeness sake for interest sake how can you manually sort
elements in a list in fact sorting is a huge topic in itself we can go on and on and even give you a
course of thirty hours duration only on sorting there are so many techniques so beautiful so deep
that it will take so much time but let us just limit our discussion to one type of sorting technique
which we showed you just now it is left for you to now go and explore more on different techniques
with which you can sort
Hello every one so today we are going to write a program for searching actually our main
objective is to understand the binary search you saw the play how a person can easily get a
search a number in a list of numbers sorted numbers very easily in a less number of steps
will see why binary search works but before that we must understand how to simply search a
number in list of list of given numbers for that we will use the linear search it is a
conventional simple search will go through each values and try to find our element which we
want to find in that list and we will see how many numbers of steps it takes and then we will
switch to binary search So I will start my spyder I will type spyder in my terminal and wait
for it ok I will write my programme in a new file entitle zero I will change the name so what
I want first I want first as list of numbers for this programme we will take the numbers in
sorted order in ascending order the numbers will always be this one two three four five
six something like that I means it should always be sorted I mean the numbers will always
been ascending order first I have to create a list of numbers for that I will write I will write a
for I in range let’s say I want numbers from one to thousand one thousand one in range if I
want a number from let’s say one to n then I have to I have to give the argument as n plus one
because it always prints up to number less than the given number I will write here let me
save this as linear search ok awesome for that I need a list so let me write the name as
element if I gives the simple bracket to create a list I will use this so in order to add elements
into a list there is a function name append I will just write elements dot see it will show you
all the functions which you can use with the list that is the beauty with spyder so it is just tap
it will give you the append and I will write here that’s it I created the list ok that’s it I can just
run this to see my list ok I will run the program I will just type element and it will show me
the numbers from one to thousand you can see all the numbers from one to thousand
awesome! So we recommend you write all the programmes in function let me create a
function here which I can easily call def linear search and I will give the range here that’s ‘n’
so that the ‘n’ I can give here also I will give the parameter ‘x’ I want to find now let’s see
this I will give the indentation ok awesome this is done I have created my list of numbers
now what I want I want to search this element ‘x’ in this list for that I write another loop for I
in see now my list is complete I have created the list I can just iterate through the elements of
this list which is very easy just I have to write since list is iterative what do I mean by
iterative You can just goggle it you will understand what is iterative there are some elements
in python which are iteratable and some are not iteratable if it is iteratable you can go through
it like a loop I will write for I in the list name which is the element ok see here element was
created I can for I can go though it here also I can element if I just print it it will give me the
elements so I can iterate through the elements through the elements of element ok for I in
element ok now I am iterating over the well use of element I will write its only one if
condition if I is equal equal to my number ‘x’ which I want to find and I will just print yes! I
found my number position str ok since in this example the numbers are sorted from one to n I
can just write str I minus one or I can simply I can write str I ok so we have to call a name ok
I have to also print that whether found the number or not if I didn’t find any number so for
that I will use the flag value let say flag is equal to zero ok initially the value is zero if I
found this number then I will put the flag value to one after that I write a if condition if flag is
equal equal to zero I print number is not found that’s it good so my programme is complete
now let me just run this and that’s it I will call the function linear search see whenever I type
this it will show me that it needs to ‘n’ and ‘x’ so n is my range so here I will put thousand
one next what number let’s say I want to search fifty ok just type it will show me yes I found
the number at position fifty because the number has sorted Ok cool now I want to know how
many iteration it took for me to get to this number for that what I will do I will create a
variable count here zero its initial value and whenever I am going through an element here I
will do count plus is equal to one I am increasing the value by one and if I don’t need to
whenever I find a number and the list I don’t need to go again go through the other elements
of the list so I will just break the loop here because I don’t need to go to find go to look at
other numbers because I already got my number so here I will break and if flag is zero it will
find and I will print the count that’s it let me write here number of iterations is equal to plus
str because I need to change this into string awesome! This is done let me check Linear
search give me one thousand sorry the number is fifty seven say ok now you can see yes I
found my number at position fifty seven number of iteration it taking is fifty seven because
before fifty seven I have to check all the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine
up to then I will go to the fifty seven so you can see that if the number of elements in the list
are very huge let’s say one million and you want to search a number which is very far end
let’s say the number I want to search is one million only then it will take one million near one
million iteration to find that number which is the very huge in the game we saw that when
we can use the advantage of sorted number whenever the number is elements in an array or
list is sorted we can use that extra information for searching a particular number easily that is
the correct for binary search so will see how we can use this extra information to search an
number in a list of sorted numbers and drastically decrease the number of iteration so that we
can in very less number of iteration or to say the very less number of time in less time we can
search the number so in next video will see the binary search and will see how we can iterate
Hello guys in last video we saw the linear search we saw how inefficient it is to search a very
big number in a very big array suppose you have million of numbers in a array and you want
to search close to million then it will take around a million of steps to search that number in
liner search so it is very inefficient because you do not have that much of memory power or
that much of even time to spend on an array of size one million and that too if the array is
sorted so here what we are going to see is the very very good algorithm known as binary
search whenever you get an array you sort it either in ascending order or in descending order
you are getting some extra information which you can used to search the search any element
in an array in very less number of steps that exactly what we are going to see here so in the
game in the game that you saw in the video there were two players one was ravi and amit
they were playing a game so ravi has an idea that he can guess a the number which amit has
thought in a very less amount of iterations so the game is like this you search you guess a
number between one to thousand and then the second person asks second person first
computes the midpoint of that array so in one to thousand the midpoint is five hundred then
he asks whether this whether the number that you have guessed is equal to five hundred or
not if it is five hundred then ok I got the number if it is not five hundred then it is he ask
whether it is less than five hundred or it is greater than five hundred so suppose the number
you have guessed is less than five hundred then you can see that you can safely discard the
other five hundred elements in the array because your number will never go beyond five
hundred you have already said it is less than five hundred and the numbers are sorted so you
can never go you do not have to search the other part of the array so you can safely discard
the numbers from five hundred to thousand so number of elements that you have left now is
one to five hundred then again the I will ask I will compute the midpoint of this array which
is left that is one to five hundred which is the midpoint is two fifty then you will then I will
ask you again whether your number is two fifty if you says yes then ok if you says no then
again I will ask whether it is less than two fifty or more than two fifty if it is more than two
fifty then again same logic I will use since it is more than two fifty it I do not have to search it
less than to fifty because it will never happen that the element will present in the array
between one to two fifty so I can safely discard the numbers from one to two fifty now the
arrays which I have left is two fifty to five hundred again I will ask the same question that is I
will compute that midpoint of two fifty to five hundred and I will use that midpoint to ask the
question and go to the left part of the array and right part of the array this is the logic of
binary system in this you are a every each iteration you are whenever you are computing the
midpoint you are discarding the half part of the array this way you are size of the array is
reducing by two at each iteration so you will exactly use this logic to do the binary search so
let me right the definition of the binary search Def binary search it will take two arguments
one is the array let’s say array name is ‘a’ and other is the element that I want to search great
now I will create two variables I will use this variables to position my array I want to know I
will create a variable let’s say first position first pos which is zero because array starts with
zero so I can safely take zero as my first position and the last position last pos sorry which is
the last position of the array python is an function named it as len through which you can
compute the length of an array so suppose if I type Len of a I will get the length of array now
it gives the length of array gives the number of elements in the array but we know that list or
array whatever you said in python starts with zero so you have to take minus one so let me try
this in console suppose my array name is array one and the elements are one comma two
comma three comma four comma five ok now if you type length of array one you will get oh
there are five elements so you will get five but the position of fifth element is what Is
actually four because the array starts with zero zero one two three four so suppose you want
to retrieve the last element will type array sorry array one and if you type four here you will
get the fifth element or you can type array length of this array one ok this length of array one
will return the number of elements in array one which is five so number of elements in array
one is five if I put minus one here so this this whole thing means it is five which is return by
the length of array one minus one which is four so this will print give me the fifth element
fourth element which is five so this is exactly what we are going to do here so I will put the
last position is length of array minus one ok also I will take a flag value which I will use to
see whether I found my element or not ok this warning means that all this variables have been
you have created this variables but you are not using it so as as soon as I use it all this
warnings will go ok now I will create a while loop let’s see how to do this And let me write
this first and I will explain it how what exactly I am trying to do So I will type first pos is
less than last pos and flag is equal equal to zero what is this mean that Keep this loop going
on until the first position is less than the last position which is this two variables if first
position is always less than last position and flag is equal equal to zero I told you flag you can
let me write a comment here flag means that flag go to zero that element is not been found so
it means that you should continue the loop until first position is less than last position and you
haven’t found the element you are looking for till than you have to continue this loop ok so
what I will do first what was the strategy so first I will compute the midpoint of the array so I
will compute mid is equal to you write so I can compute the know to compute the midpoint of
an array I will take the first element the position of first element I mean the first position of
the array and the last position of the array and I will add it and divide it by two this why I can
iteratively I can compute the midpoint of any sub array so I will write first pos plus last pos
divided by two now if I write divide by two it will return me a float value you can check here
suppose if I five plus two divide by two it is giving me three point five but I exactly want a
integer value so suppose the number is odd it should give a integer value either left or right I
don’t care much but it should give me a integer position because it is a position if I use this
float value then I will not be able to retrieve the element at that position so I need an integer
value for that I will do the int there is called as integer division in python that is I will write
five plus two to this division it will give me three this is what I want so I will put this one
more division operator here and I am done so I computed the mid now what I will check I
will check whether this element ‘x’ is present in mid or not I will write if ‘x’ is equal equal to
a of because made is of position if it is there then I am done I have to check for another thing
so I will write I will make the flag is equal to one it means I found the element and I will
write print element present at position I can write I can give the position of this mid variable
which is I can write str mid you can add plus one also so that you can get the exact position
but I am not writing it because I am assuming that you all know that array starts with zero so
in that context I am just printing the mid value that’s it you can return from here it means that
whenever you found the whenever you get the element which you are looking for you can
return it you do not have to other computation I will just return from this this return will
return the function value which I am not returning anything it means it will get out from the
function to the main I am calling the function that’s it ok now if it is not present at the mid
position then I have to check whether it is on the left side or right side for that I will write
else if it is not present at the mid position if this ‘x’ is less than array of mid which means if it
if ‘x’ is less than mid I can discard the right side of the array which means what I can safely
write that last position is shifted to what Mid minus one because mid and after mid I can
discard because mid is I the first question in the first condition I have checked whether it is
present at mid or not if it is not present at mid then I can discard the mid and all the elements
after the mid so I will safely I will reduce the size of my array by positioning the last position
to mid minus one this why I am discarding the other elements of the array or if it is not wait
sorry if it is not less than the mid it is more than the mid then I can discard the first part of the
array which is from zero to mid I can discard for that I will just shift my first position has first
pos is equal to mid plus one that’s it ok and then the programme is over and if the function
doesn’t returned anything after all these things it means the array I didn’t find the value which
I am looking for so I can safely print here after this loop it means that loop is over but still I
am not able I didn’t find the element I will write the number is not present that’s it now in last
function the linear search you were printing the number of iterations also how many iterations
it takes so here also will I would like to print the number of iteration it is taking to find this
value ‘x’ so I will create a count variable count assign it to zero and at every iteration of while
loop I will increase the value now here I have printed the element where it is present I will
just print that the number of iterations are which is string of count ok cool I just need to call
this function so in order to call this function here I will create an array so let’s say my array
name is ‘a’ and I will enter the elements in this array for I in range one to five hundred let’s
say a dot append I and I will call this function which is binary search and I have to give the
and let’s say the number I have to search is seventy so our programme is complete so I will
just run this program to see the output Ok that is showing the number is not present and I
exactly did what the logic was present for the binary search and I know that number is there
suppose if I type ‘a’ you can see that seventy which I am looking for is present but still it is
showing the element is not present let me try this for small number lets say number of
elements or ten what I want to search is four let me try this still it is showing that number is
not present let me see the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and four
is there now what is exactly happening is that whenever the condition that I put here while
first position is less than last position it might happen that some time the first position and
last position will be the one number let say first position and last position are pointing at four
at that time still we have one iteration search is required but this condition is will fail that is
first position is less than last position it is showing that here the first position is not less than
last position it is equal to last position and here it will fill and I will not be able to search this
element so to do this I have to make this condition as less then equal to which means when
first position is less than equal to last position until then you have to search for the element
now you can see if I run this it will show that number is present at position three zero one
two three and the number of iterations is four because four times I have to switch to this now
let’s see this number of elements will be hundred and one and then I will search for number
seventy and run this see the number is present at sixty nine seventy Now in linear search
what we were looking for we search for a number the number of elements we put where
thousand ok ok and we were searching for the number thousand and it was taking thousand of
iteration now here let’s see how many times how many iterations it will take I will run this
the see the number is present at position nine nine nine and in ten iterations I was able to
search this number ten iterations where it was taking thousand iteration in linear search it just
takes ten iteration in binary search suppose I make this one million let’s say ok and I want to
search this number let’s say one lack ok see how many iteration it will take in just twenty
iteration in just twenty iteration I was able to find the number whether as you all know with
to find this number it would have taken one lack iteration in linear search so this is the beauty
of binary search you can do actually it takes exactly log of the number of elements in the
array that is if the number of elements let’s say sixteen then it will take four iteration and
thirty two then five iteration and sixty four six iteration so on because every time you are
dividing by two and discarding the rest other part you are taken only one part at a time this
way one half of the array is every time discarded and you are reducing your space by two
exactly by two every time by two by two by two by two becomes log of two log of base two
so yeah we are finished with the binary search please if you have any questions post it on
discussion form or you can if you think you can this is a very simple programme you think
you can create a more efficient more elegant program like this better than this please post it
on discussion form it might help other people to learn ok guys thank you
So this is what our next joy is all about what happen Didn’t get it! Now Yes! Our next
choice is about CIPHERS
This is personally the most exciting idea throughout the course at least according to me we
are going to talk about the science of secrecy If you know what that means let me illustrate
this with an example Assume Romeo and Juliet they want to communicate with each other
secretly how would they go about communicating Assume Romeo wants to send this long a
letter to Juliet then he suspects someone in between may probably tamper with the letter and
then see what is written he wants only Juliet to read it In case someone else gets hold of the
letter they can of course read it but it should not make sense to them How would he ensure
that he encrypts the letter A very simple method goes as follows So this is the letter Romeo
wants to write for his sweetheart Juliet as you can see it’s a love letter so what he does he
firstly writes the letter and then shifts every single alphabet by five units so which means A
becomes F B becomes G and so on so from A to Z this is what happens to the letters and this
particular letter that Romeo want to send to Juliet takes this form and now the letter finally
looks something like this and Romeo sends it to his beloved Juliet and Juliet gets this and
knows what exactly Romeo has done to his original letter basically they have communicated
about this protocol before and what Juliet done has the following as you would have guessed
obviously she shifts it back five units which means she makes F A G becomes B and so on
and there you are she gets the original letter you see the shift being five is the secret key here
it can be five between Romeo Juliet and laila and majnu it can be fifteen now what if
someone gets to know that the method used by the lovers is simply shifting it by some units
and mediator comes and catches hold of the letter communicated by this boy friend to his girl
friend can he break his code So this middle man comes and catches hold of the letter sent by
our boy to his girl he knows that the idea here is shifting every single letter by few units so
what he does is try all possible shifts he first tries one shift and tries to see if the text makes
sense or not so whatever you are seeing right now let us take this three lines text as the letter
that the boy writes to his girl and then it is shifted by some units that the middle man doesn’t
know but he wants to crack it So he tries assigning A to B B to C C to D by that I mean he
assumes it to be one shift and tries to see if the text that generated makes sense or not as you
can see it is not making sense and he tries a two shift and then a three shift and then a four
and then a five and then a six and than a seven and finally when he does eight he sees that the
shift is actually making sense completely all the words are English words and hence he
concludes that the shift this boy is using happens to be eight and there he is he has
deciphered the encrypted text with his little intelligence so what do you infer from this Such
a method is used between two people to communicate can be broken easily by a mediator a
middle man if he knows provided that the technique used is shifting but he doesn’t know by
what units it being shifted so what he does He tries all possible shifts; from shift one to shift
twenty five twenty six and so on tight One of them should give him valid English text once
he gets the valid English text he concludes he has decrypted the secret What we saw just now
is called the popularly the Caesar cipher in the literature of cryptography A very well know
technique which is not being used mainly because of its simplicity and the fact that anyone
can break it now I am going to teach you a technique which is a little more complicated
rather a lot more complicated than what I explain just now the Caesar cipher I am going to
tell something else which is lot more complicated which appears as though nobody can break
this Here is a lot more complicated way of encrypting a given text and here is how it goes
You take every single English letter and assign a complicated symbol to it and a Romeo
writes along a letter for his Juliet and simply takes every single letter every single symbol
and instead of using the English alphabet letters he uses the corresponding symbols that is
agreed between Romeo and Juliet now according to what I just now illustrated A stand for
this symbol B stand for this symbol and so on up to Z and Romeo converts his letter his love
letter to something as complicated looking as this now its look like it going to be impossible
for anybody to crack this isn’t it Who on earth knows what letter is map to what letter right
This looks like a perfect way of communicating Or is it is there a way to break even this
cipher Let us take a break and let me tell you all a nice story a story that looks completely
unrelated to what we are talking but is very related There was this mom who had ten sons all
of different heights and one day the sons trying a prank on their mom they wore masks
disguising themselves and they come in front of their mom and then challenge her to identify
who is who All ten sons they appear in front of her like this and say mom identify us they
say that in chorus and mom is perplexed because she cannot see the faces of her sons but then
I told you something there are all of different heights so do you think it will be difficult for
the mom to identify who is who All ten sons are masked and they appear in front of their
mom and say mom identify us Hoping that they are they will make the mom perplexed and
that she will not able to identify them little do they know that mom can identify her sons just
by identifying their heights she knows that the shortest is this the second shortest is this third
is this so on and the tallest who is this and she goes on in no time calling out their names
patting on their back one at a time she says athri brugu kuthra vashista gowthama
kashyapa angerasa rama bheema shaama over all ten names right What exactly did she
used to identify them just their heights and what’s the moral The moral is that despite the
fact that sons concealed their identity with their mask mother used some other parameter So
what’s the moral of the story why the story am it’s are encryption decryption theory Do you
see a connection Well there indeed is a connection and this is the connection You can try to
conceal the letters in the form of symbols but then you see English speaks out aloud what do
I mean by this English has a very peculiar statistical property sounds complicated Nothing
at all It I just I just mean the following the most frequently occurring word letter in English
always happens to be this isn’t this a beautiful idea Its sounds as though it’s impossible for
anyone to decode a substitution of the letters of the English alphabet with some random
symbols its look like it’s impossible to break this code but you see how English speaks out
aloud and anybody can very easily decrypt the text The seemingly looking seemingly
complicated looking technique has a huge loop whole in fact it is as easy as a previous one
that we discussed So this subject is called cryptography where the idea is all about making
ciphers and also breaking it almost every single technique that has come about the history is
broken and the ones that is currently in place I believe are just in the status of yet to be
broken so the science of secrecy is all about making and breaking the codes it is reached
than what I illustrated just now I invite you all to read more of it I will give you some
references to good books for the same you can go ahead and read more of what makes
cryptography
The professor just now explained a method to share your messages secretly so let me try to
show you how can you share your messages in a secret way Hello every one before we start
doing the programme for substitution cipher I would like to explain the concept in python
name string First of all what is a string String is used to represent text in python; text may
comprise of spaces numbers and even alphabets So how can you use string here for that
first of all you need to import a library called string Now take a variable named x and I
would initialised it to a string for example it is hello world please note the fact that every
time you initialise a string you have to close the string in double quotes you have to close a
string in double quotes So here we have the string called “hello world” and if you want to
excess a particular alphabet in the string x what you can do here is you can excess the
particular alphabet in “hello world” by giving it a particular number For example if I want to
excess ‘H’ in “hello world” I would write print x of zero as you know the indexing start from
zero in arrays as well as in strings so if I want to excess the alphabet H in “hello world” what
will start from zero so ‘H’ is at zeroth position so I would write print ‘x’ of zero so here we
have h and for example if I want to excess the alphabet ‘O’ here ‘O’ has two occurrences so
if I want to excess the alphabet ‘O’ in the first position that is how can you do it ‘H’ is at
zeroth position ‘e’ is at first position ‘n’ is at second second l is at third position and that ‘O’
is at fourth position since ‘O’ is at fourth position I will write x of four and now let us see
what is the output here we have ‘O’ so this is how you can excess the alphabets at particular
position in a string ok There are many other functions available in string for example if I
want to excess the alphabets from second position to fifth position how can you do that You
can actually do it in one go without even using for loop or any kind of loop so I will just say
‘x’ of two colon five and I will just print it prints llo this is how you can excess the alphabets
in particular range of positions ok now if I want to know if I want to get the length of the
string so for that you have a function what you need to do is you will write Len and then Len
and in bracket write the name of the string here we have ‘x’ so we will write ‘x’ so let us
print it so it is eleven you can clearly see that the length of string ‘x’ is eleven now if I want
to convert the string in upper case there is straight away a function available in python what
you can do here is you just write the name of the string that is ‘x’ and then dot and then you
have to write upper upper is a function available in python used to convert the available
string in upper case so now let us see what is the output for that we should print it print ‘x’
dot upper yes it converts the string or string “hello world” to upper world to upper case So
we are done with the strings now there is one more function available in python in fact there
are many more functions but here I would like to explain you one more for example in “hello
world” if I want to replace one alphabet by some other alphabet how can you do that I will
just write ‘x’ dot replace for example I have to replace ‘h’ with the ‘j’ so I will just write
replace ‘h’ in double quotes comma then ‘j’ in double quotes so now the output is “jello
world” instead of hello world so this is about strings in python now we will do the
programme for substitution cipher and will use strings there
So let us try to code substitution cipher here for substitution cipher we have an input file here
named ip underscore file it has some text I need to convert this text in such a way so that it is
not recognise by the third person for that I will be using substitution cipher so for that I need
a string of alphabets in which I can substitute the letters python provide with the string
named string dot ascii underscore letters I will print it so I will write print string dot ascii
underscore letters as you can see we have the letters in lower case as well as in the upper case
so I will be substituting this string in such a way so that it is not recognise the text present in
our input file is not recognise by the third person I will be using this particular string for that
so in order to execute the substitution part I will write import string after that I will initialise a
dictionary called dict I hope that you are already familiar with dictionaries strings as well as
file handlings because will be using all three of them in this particular programme and if you
are not familiar with these concepts I would suggest you to go though the previous videos
please go through the previous videos and then watch this programming screen cast Now we
have dictionary named dict is equal to dict is equal to curly braces this is how we initialise a
dictionary for converting this particular string to a substituted format I will write for I in
range length string dot ascii underscore letters In this particular dictionary if any letter is at
ith position I will be substituting it by I minus one position position letter it’s your choice by
with which letter you want to substitute a particular letter here if I am substituting a letter
given letter by its them by the previous letter so we will have here ‘A’ will be substituted by
‘Z’ ‘B’ would be substituted by ‘A’ ‘C’ would be substituted by ‘B’ ‘B’ would be substituted
by ‘C’ This is how our dictionary is going to work so I will write string dot ascii letters
string dot ascii underscore letters at ith position will be substituted by string dot ascii
underscore letters at I minus one position here I used minus one you can even use plus one
plus two even minus two minus three it’s your wish I am substituting it my minus oneth
letter so that you can tip your get idea of how our programming is working it would be easy
to observe this particular dictionary so I will just print dictionary here so that so you can get
the idea of what is happening over here So here we have the dictionary as you can see capital
‘z’ is ‘A’ substituted by capital ‘Z’ ‘B’ is substituted by ‘A’ ‘C’ is substituted by ‘B’ ‘D’ is
substituted by ‘C’ this is how our substitution is working so we have all the substitution in
this particular dictionary named dict now we will use this dictionary dict to convert our input
file For that first of all we need to open our input file named ip underscore file so I will write
with open ip underscore file dot txt as f then I will write while true I need to read this file by
character by character and I need to substitute a particular character according to the
dictionary so I will take a variable here named ‘C’ ‘C’ is equal to f dot read now I need to
check one or two things here first of all I will be checking whether we have encounter end of
file or not for that I will write if not ‘c’ if the if the file pointer hasn’t encounter any
character that means it has reached end of file so in this particular case we will print end of
file and it will break out of this file loop and if ‘c’ if the file pointer has encounter a ‘c’ which
is already present in the dictionary if ‘C’ in dict in that particular case I will take a string here
name data please initialise the string data here how can you do that You can initialise
through double quotes so we have initialise our string data data is equal to dict of ‘C’ if ‘C’
is present in dictionary in that particular case data will be equal to dict of ‘C’ and if ‘C’ is not
present in the dictionary then we can’t do anything will just write data is equal to ‘C’ instead
of dict of ‘C’ please note the fact that in our dictionary dict only alphabets are present in
lower case as well as upper case and if in our file some if in our file some integers zero to
nine or some special symbols are present that will not be substituted so here is an exercise for
you if you encounter a file with some special symbols and integers how can you apply
substitution factor on that particular file its an exercise to you its left to you how can you do
that So here we have the string data which has the substituted file which has a substituted
data so I will just print it I will just write print data let us try to print this So now we have
the data but the data is exactly like the input file so there is some error in our programme
here if we are reading the file we need to supply a bullion value here so I will just supply one
and try to read it here we have the substituted file so here is the mistake when we are reading
the file when we need to supply some bullion value here one here So as you can see that it
has substituted our input file and this is something we can’t read and we can’t recognise ok so
what will I do here is I will store this output in a file you can get a clear cut idea of the
substitution happening over here so I will take another file here named file is equal to open
op underscore file dot txt and I will open this file in writing mode since we need to write it
and what next we need to do here is I need to write this particular string data in our file so I
will just write here file dot write under curly braces we will write data ok after we are done
with the writing part I will close this file I will write file dot close round braces so now let us
try to run this programme again so here we have the substitute text let us open the file output
file or op underscore op underscore file as you can see here we have the data in the
substituted form this is something we can’t recognise we can’t figure out that this text was
actually this and we have substituted it by using substitution cipher so now we are done with
the programme I will go through the program again First of all there is a string present in
python name string dot ascii underscore letters we use this string for the substitution part here
we are substituting the letters present in the string by I minus oneth letter here we have for
that we are using dictionary we have initialise the dictionary here in dict after that we are
executing the substitution part in this particular part we are writing dict string dot ascii
underscore letters at ith position will be substituted by I minus oneth letter this is how we are
doing the substitution please note that dict dictionary has dictionaries have keys and value in
this particular dictionary keys are the letters present in the string and the values are the
substitute letters I repeat keys are the values present in the string and values are the substitute
letters after that we are opening our file our input file and we are reading a character by
character for that we need to supply a bullion variable here one as to read the file character by
character then we are checking some conditions here first condition we are checking here is
whether we have encounter the end of file or not if we have encountered end of file in that
particular case our programme will print end of file and it will break out of this loop and we
are checking if the particular character present in the input file is actually present in our
dictionary if it is not present then it will then it will only write this ‘C’ in data otherwise if it
is present it will write dict of ‘C’ the substituted letter in the data At the end we are writing
this string data in output in an output file so that we can get the clear cut idea of how the
substitution is working and then we are printing the data and finally we are closing the file
So as you can see here we have two files here this is the output file and this is the input file
here the in input file you can read the text but in output file the output file is converted to
some other text using the substitution cipher which is not recognised which can’t be
recognised by the third person until and unless he gets to know that the substitution cipher is
used here so this is how you quote for substitution cipher and convert many more text I hope
this programming screen cast was useful to you guys Happy learning
Do you remember this Do you remember this And this Yes And next choice is about TIC
TAC TOE
That was such a good time we used to play a lot of games in our childhood I was just going
through some of my old books my rough note book would look like this when you scan it
from back I guess most of you are getting these nostalgic memories on seeing this this is the
famous game called tic tac toe which we all used to play in our childhood we love playing it
such a enjoyable it’s such a good memories we are re living it this feels so great so in this
lecture series I would take you down your memory lane you all shall re live your childhood
days the fun way through computing That were good old memories we all had almost played
this game in our childhood for those who want to re live those memorable days I would start
with the rules of the game the game is something like this there is a three cross three board
which is nothing but board containing three rows and three columns that is a total of nine
cells There are two players who are involved in this game each player is given a symbol one
is given a symbol ‘X’ one is given a symbol ‘O’ they are suppose to alternate their turns
during their turns the player is expected to occupy a vacant slot in the board when they
alternate their turns the one who is able to occupy three slots such that the three slots come in
one single row or the three single slots come in one single column or they occur along this
diagonal or this diagonal or one of the diagonal the one who is able to do this first is
considered the winner this is how the game goes if no one is able to occupy their positions in
such a manner then it is declare a draw no one wins this is how the game goes I hope most
of you had gone back to your childhood days if you would observe the rules of the game this
is much more than you playing established your victory This is much more than that the
planning the thinking involved requires a lot of envision ability you need to envision what
would be your move as well as what would be the move your opponent make given his next
turn you have to envision both you would play such that you increase your chances you
maximise your chances of winning as well as the you minimise the chances that your
opponent wins this is how the intelligent player would play this game so when both players
play intelligently the game would mostly be a draw This particular strategy where you want
to maximise the chances of your winning and minimise the chances of opponents winning is
called the min max strategy this is min max strategy which is a very famous game strategy
and all such min max games are too thrilling and given that this joy of computing course we
would now see how we shall play this game in the fun way using computers Hello guys
welcome to the programming screen cast of tic tac toe we had some discussion about the
game which we played in our childhood namely the tic tac toe It has the three cross three
board that is nothing but the board consisting of three rows and three columns that is the nine
cells so according to us that is three rows that is row one row two row three column one
column two column three that is how we count but computers count in a different way let me
show you see this is how the index is done in a computer for a board sort of structure this is
nothing but matrix basically this is a matrix for a computer that is 2d array that is the two
dimensions there are two dimensions namely the rows and the columns so it’s the 2d array
this is how the computers represent the board has that is how they interpret the board as see
the counting starts from zero zero one two that is how it counts we count as one two three so
please note that if we say second row second column then it is first row first column for the
computers so that is whatever is our count you subtract one from it then you will get the
count as per the computer perspective this is how we have to we have to take care of the
perspectives of humans and computers first I would like to tell you this regarding the
indexing part ok now let’s get started with the game basically let me just give you a brief
overview here let me give you see this is three cross three board that is the board containing
three rows and three columns so players there are two players in this game each players is
given a symbol one is given a symbol ‘X’ one is given a symbol ‘O’ they have to initially the
board is fully empty we have to place their symbols in one of this vacant positions in the
board this is how the game goes suppose player one places here next time player two cannot
occupy the same position he has to occupy the vacant position something like that the game
goes and if you would see the players who occupies consecutive three cells along any of the
rows or any of these columns or along this diagonals or this diagonal is consider to be the
winner That is the player who is able to first occupy three consecutive cells in this manner is
the winner in case no one is able to do then it is a draw so here as I had discussed in the
lecture the game is not just about your moves it is about your ability to predict how your
opponent will play so every player will play keeping in mind that he has to maximise his
chances of winning and minimise the chances of opponents winning for example let me just
give you overview it is better if you could have a pen and paper draw a board because for
indexing purposes I have taken this particular image but plane board be a beneficial but no
problem you please take a paper and draw this kind of grid and follow my instructions and
based on that you can understand so this is basically an empty board initially so the first
player comes places his symbol here why this place Because along this diagonal or rows or
columns any way at least one of this ways he has to occupy three consecutive positions only
then he can win maximise his chances of winning this particular position one comma one for
the computer and second row second column for humans this particular position is
intersection of many of the winning possibilities along this diagonal along this diagonal row
this column along four of the winning possibilities there are three columns three rows two
diagonals among eight winning possibilities on four of the wining possibilities this particular
cell is present so smart player would start playing this position to maximise his chances of
winning So this will be the first players move so the second player when he gets the move in
the next turn he would want to maximise his chances of winning also to block him from the
winning that is to minimise his chances he wants to block him from winning so here if you
have a ‘X’ so he would like to block one of the four wining possibilities for him so maybe he
can place his coin somewhere here so that this row possibility has been block now given that
this row possibility has been block in the next turn if the player ‘X’ places his coin here it is a
waste so he would place his coin somewhere here so now if you have seen till now here you
have ‘X’ here you have ‘O’ here you have ‘X’ so if somehow this is now ‘O’s turn if
somehow in the next turn ‘X’ could be placed here ‘X’ would be the winner ‘O’ thinks in that
way if I miss this particular location next time ‘X’ will place his coin here and he would be
the winner so he would place his coin ‘O’ here to block his winning opportunity I guess now
you have understood what the strategy the players would be using they would want to
maximise their chance of winning as well as they would like to minimise the chance of the
opponent winning if both the players are smart this try dry running some any sequence of run
if try dry running just think that both the players are equally smart it would be a draw In case
if at some point of time the player losses the foresightedness he doesn’t think of his opponent
in some point of time suppose assume that in this particular instance ‘O’ doesn’t place his
coin here he places somewhere here the next turn when it for ‘X’ ‘X’ would place his coin
here than thinking of blocking O it is beneficial for him to place his coin and win so your
aim will be both more priority to your winning at the same time not a minimum priority to
defeating your opponent you have to minimise his chance of winning you have to block him
as much as possible as well as increase your chances of occupying three consecutive cells so
that you can win so this is how the game goes as I have recommended if you had taken a
blank sheet of paper and dry run how the game would go just play the game without using a
computer just try you would understand how the game is played what kind of smartness is
required from the player for the game and so on so this is how the game goes so let us now
start coding now ok so as I had said it is a 2d array the board is the 2d array for the computer
so that arrays has been defined in a package called num py let me import it import numpy I
had import it so let me call it as board that is the name easier for me so let me call it as board
I would say numpy numpy dot array array of we need an array of three rows and three
columns we need to give it as a list and within the list each row as to be a separate list so you
have blanks initially so for blanks I am representing it as hyphens that it is a blank cell that is
what I mean by hyphens here so I have three columns in each row so three hyphens I would
be giving so all these three or blanks sorry for this first row has been given now the second
row so let me give ok second row is over now the third row ok first column of the third row
second column of the third row then third column of the third row so all three rows has been
defined ok now for player one the symbol I allocate is X I had told it is ‘X’ for player two I
allocate the symbol O so that is what I had defined here player one symbol player one symbol
for symbol I am using ‘X’ player one symbol is ‘X’ player two symbol is ‘O’ so now let me
start the game let me say play As we would have seen till now just saying play serve the
purpose because it is something we are defining see you got a morning symbol it is an
undefined name so we have to give the proper definition as to what as to be done when you
say play so let me define it define play ok give colon here so here start the function definition
So every particular turn turn has to be alternated the first turn if it is given for ‘X’ second
turn must be given for ‘O’ so how many turns would be given totally It is three cross three
grid that is there are nine cells so there will be nine turns so let me say for I will use a for
loop because I need to repeat it nine times turn I use intuitive name so that it is easier to
understand turn in the range you would have seen this syntax till now this is how you use for
loop for a pre defined number of times I wanted nine times so let me say nine for turn till the
range of nine what you do is it start from zero till eight it will count so zero two four six all
these turns should correspond to player ‘X’ that then one three five seven that is even turns is
for player x and odd turns is for player ‘O’ so how do we capture this Using the modulo
operator let’s do that So I will use if turn modulo two is equal to zero that is if it is an even
turn you should say it is the turn of ‘X’ let me print ‘X’ turn so this is turn of ‘X’ ok so you
should allow him to place his symbol on the board so let me call place player one symbol and
then after he places his symbol initial two moves if you would have observed the winning
possibility from the fifth move only but still this single loop will be running for all the turns
so let us include this check here but it will not be used in the initial stages but in the
subsequent stages it would be needed that is as soon as there is a winning move that is if
there is some vacant slot still not that is all nine slots have not been occupied but still there is
there was a winning move then the game has to stop so for that let me say you have to if won
let me use terminology like this if one if someone this player one symbol this person has won
then break that is you should quit the game this is nothing but we are quitting the game else
so this is for player ‘X’ we had done else that is the turn is odd turn so all these things we
would copy we would do this for player two whose symbol is ‘O’ so I had used ‘O’ player
two symbol and if player two symbol this particular thing has won we have to check that is
why do we check this As you would have seen in this dry run during the fifth turn there is a
possibility that one player can win that is from fifth turn any turn anyone can win there are
good amount of possibilities that there can be a winning move so if that particular move if he
has placed it in some position and if that placement is a winning placement then you should
quit the game that is why we are using this so far so good this are intuitiveness so I guess you
can understand it that is you have to repeat this things nine times that is because of the nine
cells present in the board if for every even number turn this is for ‘X’ and odd numbered is
for O allow the player to place his symbol into the into a vacant slot in the board check if that
is a winning placement quit this is what we have done till now Ok as you could see here see
these are undefined names place and won so let me defined that here now ok define place so
we have used p one s p two s let me say symbol it is a common terminology player one
symbol player two symbol whatever this is be the it is a symbol so I had said that ok so first
what should I do Print the board so since it is a matrix that is I have to display it in the rows
and columns format for that we have a predefined functionality to convert it into this is in the
list format we need to convert it into rows and columns format for this we have a predefined
functionality let us use it numpy dot matrix there is a functionality here numpy dot matrix
within in that you have to pass the name of the variable here it is board that is it will take the
value of the board in list format convert it into the row and column format and print it that is
a purpose of this functionality ok we will print the board then we have to say we have to get
the input for in which particular row that is how does it what does it signify if I is you are
saying that you should allow him to place his coin where would he place In some particular
cell that is identified by the row number and the column number so row get the value input
from the user row is an integer so let me type cast it initially its easier now ok row I should
get an input this is actually dependency on Mac system that’s it in Linux systems as much as I
have used this particular type casting thing is needed these are all some trivial things depends
on your operating systems in case you are using some other systems and there is some other
requirement you can always Google it and get back the correct method as per your system
this I am doing it with respect to the Mac system ok so I had type casted I am taking the input
so I should say enter your rowth position enter row what are the values for rows that is
allowed One or two or three these are the allowed rows ok that is as per the humans
perspective I told you counting that starts from zero why why is it that we are giving one two
three here because this is as per the human perspective you are familiar with computers so
you can understand this indexing mechanism but where as if you would ask this must be
designed so that anyone can play the game so for human perspective the counting starts from
one that’s why we are giving like this then adjust it in the upcoming steps so you get the input
and copy paste ok column so I should say enter column column one or two or three so I had
said that this is the value you have to input it but what if the person has inputted a row and
column that is already occupied or what if by some type of mistake or something he has
inputted a value that is out of range of the board we have to handle it all these we are doing it
to ensure that your programme is robots and fault tolerance that is whatever be the fault that
may be occurring due to the users input it must be handle your programme your programme
must be able to handle it we should not say that it is your mistake we should be able to handle
it as much as possible that is one of the principle in software engineering that you have to
make your systems friendly and fault tolerant that is if user commit some mistake even your
software may be able to handle it you must be able to display him some polite nice message
that this is the reason why this cannot be accepted please try again with the valid thing
something like that that is courteously that is the practice followed generally so let us do that
here so let me check if so if it is a valid input I have to say ok you can place it how would I
do that In case if it is an invalid input I should repeat the process so I need to I need to use
while loop here so let me use it while one because it has to turn infinitely till you get the
correct input so correct input so if it is a correct input I have to break so what is the correct
input Row the value of row is greater than zero one or two or three all are greater than zero
right and the value of row is less than four one two three all are less than four and even
column must be same like this column should be greater than zero and column is less than
four and that must be a vacant column for vacant what are we using it We are using a hyphen
so I am going to check that one board of should we use row column Or row minus one
column minus one it is row minus one and column minus one why do we use it As I had
shown you the indexing earlier computers start counting from zero where as humans start
counting from one this we have taken the input in a human friendly manner but we have to
convert it into a computer friendly manner that is why we are deducting one as I had shown
you that time second row and second column of humans is nothing but one comma one for
computers so you have to subtract from both the indices row as well as column this is how
the computers works so if the humans says second row first column it is nothing but two
minus one first row and one minus one zero first row zeroth column for the computer so this
is how the computer will inter crypt because why is this different Because humans start
counting from one computers start counting from zero that is the reason so if this particular
thing is blank blank is given by hyphen if all these conditions are satisfied that is row and
column are within this range one or two or three so it is greater than zero or less than four is
nothing but one two or three and column is also the same and if the deserve vacant position
then it is a valid input you can break here that is you can let him play yes broken from the
loop so corresponding to this here you should let him place board of row minus one and
column minus one is nothing but the symbol whatever the symbol he wants to place this is
how the place functionality works please check once again It is you are displaying the board
asking them for input to enter row and column value in case if they enter a faulty input or if
that is not a vacant position you will repeat asking for inputs till they enter and if you again
and again ask inputs they will get irritated so you should say if this particular this is for
checking that whether the input is a valid input if it is not a valid input you should print
saying that invalid input invalid input please enter again some polite message only then they
will understand that ok we had made a mistake and that is why you are asking the input again
and again otherwise they may think that there is some fault in the system that’s why even
though I gave an input it is asking again that is what people will think that is why we have to
print a message in a way that they can understand easily this is important please note this this
is important so we will ask input as long as it is not valid once it is valid we break from this
loop and place that particular players symbol here so see place players one symbol in even
number turn player two symbol in odd number turn so whatever is the symbol being pass here
that would be placed in that position so this is how it happens so place has been done so
please see to the flow till now may be you can pause here for some time and then you can see
it and yeah see we had missed one more thing if player one has won we should say break
player two has won you should say break if no one has won at the end of nine turns that the
all the cells have been occupied and still no one has won we should see we should tell that
that has to be included so let us include it if you should say if that is not won if that person
has not won player one has not won see not is an operator that is predefined that is one will
say if the person has won or not that is it is true or false If it says true if you are applying not
it would become false so it will invert the output of this particular thing it will invert
whatever is the truthfulness into it that is what not does ok and not player two is also not won
not won of player two symbol if both haven’t won then you should print it is a draw ok so
why did we do that Because draw is also possible so that is why we had done this this ok
indentation is important it has to be at this particular position only column five because at the
end of all turns only you have to check that is all nine cells have been occupied and still no
one has won that means it is a draw so we are checking it here fine let me change the
indentation here too ok so this and this will be in the same level yeah nine and column nine
fine ok please pass till here understand the flow of the programme and in the next video we
will see how this functionality won which has whether the person has won or not can be
realised Aright guys in the previous video we had seen the outline of the game we have a
play method and we had a place method; play method alternates the turn between the players
‘X’ and ‘O’ Even number turns is for ‘X’ and odd number turns is for ‘O’ and place method
checks whether the position is a valid one and a vacant one it is so it allows the players to
place it if not it asks for input again and again till he gives the valid position so this is how
game had gone till now so let us see this particular thing that has been undefined won so let
us define that method now define won so won we have a same thing symbol as an argument
we have been passing symbol so let us see so what should you check Check rows you
should check for rows if any of the rows has been occupied or you should check for columns
if any of the columns has been occupied in a consecutive manner or check the diagonals
diagonals if any of the diagonals has been occupied so you have to check all these things and
return the answer any of these things has been occupied then that person has won So see
check rows check columns check diagonals all these are intuitive to us we have to define it
let us define it one by one check rows define check rows we have pass the symbol ok I need
to check each of the three rows so I need to use a variable check this so let me call as row r
let me call it as r r in the range of there are zeros so let me say three r in the range of three
for each row I will have a counter count is initially zero that is we haven’t counter the
occurrence of that symbol in the row so count is initially zero now let me iterate through
every cell in the row for that let me use c column that is each row has three columns has a
cell of three columns right one cell belonging to each column we have it so we have to
iterate over each of these cells for c for cell or column you can take anything for c in the
range of three because each row has three cells ‘c’ is in the range of three so let me call it I
will say if board at the r and c index contains the symbol I will increment my counter count
equal to count plus one why do I use the counter here Because it may be the case that in
some column or in some row ‘X’ ‘X’ and the third thing may be ‘O’ in that case it is not
winning placement XXX is a winning placement so I need to count how many times I had
seen the symbol ‘X’ so that is why I am using something called as counter at the end of this
loop where we had iterated over each cell I will check the value of the counter if counter is
equal to three because each row has three cells if all three cells have the same symbol then it
is a winning move I should print that it is a winning move so let me print this particular
symbol has won let me say this person has won and I will return true here I am returning so
this particular functionality comes to an end in case if the first row doesn’t satisfy it the loop
for r will be check once again and for the second loop same check would be done for the third
row the same check would be done so once for all the rows this check has been done and
none of the places this has been encounter that means there is no winning movement along
the rows so in that case this check rows thing here that is winning is not due to occupying
three consecutive cells or any row along any row the person has not occupied three
consecutive cells so in that case you should say it is not a winning thing so I should return
false that is the person has not occupied three consecutive cells along any row that is the
meaning here I hope you can understand this check rows functionality otherwise no problem
you can pause the video here dry run the code and you will definitely understand it So check
rows is done check columns is pretty much similar so let me just copy paste it copy let me
paste ok this is check columns just the name and some indices change because here a column
value is fixed rows changed so let me change this as c and r so the rows change that is the
column value is fixed rows change that’s the only change here otherwise it is pretty much the
same I guess you can understand this we would let me show you see in check rows we fix up
this row we check each cell we count in check columns we fix up the column in each of the
row corresponding cell we count if you don’t understand please don’t worry dry running is
the key here you sit think like a computer just have a index table something like this and dry
run it you will definitely understand it it is very easy for all that it requires is some amount of
thinking that’s it it’s very easy please make sure that you understand till here ok check rows is
done check columns is done now check diagonals so yeah I will show here wait ok see the
diagonals zero comma zero one comma one two comma two the general format it is of the
form I comma I so both the values are same along this diagonal and this diagonal differs so
let us three cells so let us manually do it two comma zero one comma one zero comma two so
please make a note of these values that’s it so for this I comma I general format you can use a
loop something similar to what we are use in rows and columns just for that other case we
need to use the thing manually let us do it now define check diagonals check diagonals for
the symbol check it so for that diagonal let us do it if board of zero or maybe we can even
manually do it no problem it is up to you you can use a loop as well as you can do manually
anything zero two is equal to board of one one that is allowed in maths but not in
programming so we have to use and operator and we have to say board of one one is equal to
board of two comma zero that is one of the diagonals and that particular thing is equal to this
corresponding symbol only then this person has won so let me check it you can use any of the
three values I am using one comma one that I equal to symbol in that case you say this
particular symbol has won and you return true ok next is along the other diagonal here you
are returning so in case if this diagonal has been satisfied this particular functionality would
come to an end if this diagonal has not been satisfied only then the control would be
transferred here you have to check this diagonal board of zero comma zero is equal to board
of one comma one and board of one comma one is equal to board of two comma two and
board of one comma one is equal to symbol this can be return using the loop as well I will
leave it as an exercise for you guys please do try using a loop to simplify this thing instead of
using these many comparisons you can simplify it alright if that is the case then this is pretty
much the same so let me copy paste it copy paste ok in case if both the cases didn’t satisfy
then it means along the diagonals there is no winning move in that case you have to return
false so you had checked rows checked columns checked diagonals and see this won
functionality is check rows or check columns or check diagonals if in one of the places or
operator works in this manner if at least one of this values is true the final answer is true if
along the row or along the columns or along the diagonals there is a winning movement then
you would return true that is that person has won if all three places there is no winning
movement only then it will return false that is this person has not won so this is how this
functionality works ok let me save it ok so I hope you would have understood the code till
now please do pause understand the flow of the code really well and then proceed towards
running the code you can try dry running it as I said dry running is the best way to
understand the computers perspective please do understand really well before proceeding
further let us run this code and see what happens in the next video

Alright guys in the previous video we had seen how to quote for this game so we had a play
method which alternates the turn between the players even number turns are for ‘X’ odd
number turns for ‘O’ During his turn he has to place symbol in a vacant position so here we
take care that his input is proper within the range as well as the position is vacant So based
on this this functionality works and for checking the winning moves we have a functionality
one it checks the rows with their any of the rows three consecutive cells has been occupied
by this player or along the columns or along the diagonals so since we are using or operator
works in the fashion that if one of the value is true then final answer would be true so if all
three ways the player has not occupied only then it will say it is false that is this person has
not won only then it will say something like this this is how the functionalities works I hope
you had passed i had asked you to dry runner i hope you had dry run and you have a clear
idea of how the code works how the flow is please do that make sure that you are very very
clear in it then you run the code alright I hope you are now very clear let us proceed towards
running the code Ok let me run it see it is extend and i have in a matrix format so it is asking
me to enter the row let as i had said two comma two is the smartest move because you have
four winning possibilities in which that particular cell is intersecting so let me say two
column is also two see it has place the cell ‘X’ here let me now you could see initially the
board was empty now i said two comma two has to be occupied so it has occupied So now if
i would give again two comma two see its saying invalid input because it is not a vacant
position so let me give some other input one comma two so this position has been occupied
so this is ‘X’ turn so let me give some input two comma one this is x turn so for the player
‘O’ this is the optimal placement what if he chooses some other position why this is an
optimal thing because if he leaves this opportunity here in the next turn ‘X’ may win so he
shouldn’t leave this so let me say if he didn’t predict the next move what could be and he has
chosen something else he wants to maximise his winning chance now this is ‘X’ turn so he
may win here ‘X’ has won it displays the message that ‘X’ has won so if as you would have
as you would have seen it is important that both players are equally smart try that variant as
well try playing in that way you would definitely see a draw if both players are equally
smart alright guys thanks for watching till now please do try different variant and also for tic
tac toe there are many more variants you can browse online please do try a different kind of
variant and discuss in the discussion form of what are the variants you have discussed how
did you implement What are your strategies What are the new things you came across
Please do discuss everything as clear learning is the best way to learn please do discuss with
your Ta’s and i wish you a happy leaning Have a nice day Alright now we have seen one of
the implementations of tic tac toe there are actually many such implementations possible
there are many other ways also there are some variants to the game as well you can look up to
it and I would recommend you that try implementing some other variant which we haven’t
discuss and please do discuss the strategies that you take up to implement those variants you
explain those variants the strategies you take up please do discuss all those things in the
discussion form happy leaning
So we have a box here there is another box inside this box and there is another box inside
this box there is another box inside this box you must be wondering what I am doing Then
it is called recursion so let us discuss about it
Sir may I talk to you for five minutes Yeah sure Sir actually I would like to show you this
comedy scene I see that you are always obsessed with movies when are you going to discuss
with me something technical Sir actually you are sort of person who actually sees
computing in every walk of life this is something we generally use in computing acha such a
concept is there in this clip so I would like to show you Sure sure show me This clip is it
Yeah yes sir Sir did you just see what happened here Isn't this the concept we use in
computing namely the recursion Very much so that’s a good find vidya this is a very
interesting scene so I will do one thing I will try explaining what exactly is happening here
huh Concentrate look there are several people right There are some let’s say fifteen people
yes sir correct And then this very person first person asks a question to his neighbour right
And then he asks that question to his neighbour so this kind of a caste gate continuous you
see and goes till the first person and some where here this fellow knows what is the answer
he tells him the answer and the caste gate comes back and hits the source and there you are
bingo! You have the answer Right So this is exactly sort of how recursion works you keep
passing on the requirement was function inside a function and it goes inside and inside well
within the last step and comes back and there you are with the answer that’s a very good
observation vidya very nice very creative of you Thank you sir Recursion is a very
powerful tool in computer science and we are going to illustrate that with a standard example
called computing factorial of a number We all know factorial of a number it’s a very easy
thing to compute so fact of five is five into four into three into two into one we all have been
doing it from our school days right Which is actually one twenty So what is factorial Let us
take a look at it Factorial of a number let’s say six is six times five times four times three
times two times one do you observe that fact of six is six times fact of five what do I mean I
mean factorial of a number one can compute by computing factorial of a number one less
than that multiplied by the number so fact of n is n times fact of n minus one So let me thing
of how one could write a program to compute factorial of a number That’s going to be very
easy if the input is n I will just write a for loop and then for I equals one to n I will say
answer is answer times I initializing answer to one pretty straight forward right The best
thing about computer programming is that one can do the same thing in several ways I told
you how to compute factorial of a number I will now tell you how to compute it in a way
that is slightly complicated but I am going to introduce to you all a very important
programming idea called the recursion Remember how I defined factorial of a number We
observed that factorial of n is n times factorial n minus one so how about this I define fact
function and then all that I do is written n times fact of n minus one whenever n is greater
than one if it is any if n is equal to one I simply written one and that’s what this programme s
doing now wait a minute I am I am defining a function and calling a functions name within
the same function isn't that weird There is actually nothing weird about it every
programming language gives you this facility the facility of calling the same function within
itself and python also gives you this facility as you can see this programme will simply give
you factorial of a number Try to understand what is happening here you are computing a
function by giving as a input a number and the function is calling another instance of itself I
am sure my terminologies are sounding complicated but you will get used to it as you see
more examples on recursion Hello guys I hope you would have seen the concept of factorial
of a number let me just give you a brief over view of what it is Factorial of a number is
nothing but you keep repeatedly multiplying the number starting from one till you reach the
given number and what is the answer you get is nothing but you call as a factorial of a
number let me give you an example Let us take the number four start with one next
number it is we have not reached four yet so take the next number two multiply it one into
two is two still we have not reached four so take the next number three multiply it two into
three is six we have not reached four so take the next number it is four we have reached four
so with this multiplication we need to stop so till now we got the six as the answer of
multiplication and multiply four to it you get twenty four that is your answer so we say
factorial of four is twenty four that is one into two into three into four is twenty four that is
what you call as factorial of a number You start from one and keep multiplying the next
numbers until you reach the given number ‘n’ to get the factorial of the number ‘n’ if ‘n’ is
the given number in my case its four n is equal to four so if the given number is n you start
off with one two three and so on till you reach n keep multiplying and what is the final
answer you get is what you call as ‘n’ factorial ok so how would we programme it As you
would have guessed from the procedure of calculation I had said we can do it using iteration
let us do that so I said factorial that is the functionality we need so let us define a
functionality factorial for we need to find the factorial of given number ‘n’ so let me define n
here ok so I need to start from one and go till I reach n so we can use for loop right But for
loop uses the function range to deal with numeric values and as you would have seen in your
previous videos and till you practice you had till now range function would take if you ask
for range of five it would start by default zero and it will count till four that if you would say
five it will count one less than that that is how it does But we want it to start form one and
we want it to count till n ok so we need to tweak in the range function to get this thing so we
can define the start value for the range function if we don’t give a start value till now we had
an given the start value for most of our programs so if we don’t give a start value the default
start value is taken as zero but we can tweak in we can give some start values as well so let
me do that in this program so I need to store the product so let me a variable call product so
initially we have one as the product because with one of you multiply anything you will get
the same number as the answer so you keep multiplying but from where will you start one
into one into two into three into four into up to n this is how this has to been done right so we
have to start our multiplication from one let me define something called as product which
carries the value one initially ok so let me use the loop to iterate over the range that is to
move over the range of numbers from one till n so I need to start from one so let me for I in
range of I can give a start value as I had said start value one comma stop value so whatever
is the stop value it will stop one less than that I want to stop at ten so what should I be giving
here N plus one a simple tweak so in this range that is from one to n
plus one that is one two three it will count up to n so this is what we wanted we had taken that
value as ‘i’ whatever is the new product after taking this ‘i’ will be whatever the product till
now multiply with ‘i’ I hope you understand this that is if I want the factorial of three
whatever is the product how will I do One one into two is two till now my product is two
two into three is six this is how I take the factorial so whatever is the product we had
computed till now that product into this particular value of ‘i’ this is how we compute the
factorial So at the end of the loop that is till you have reached ‘n’ whatever you keep
multiplying whatever is the product that is your answer so you have to return the product
here so this particular functionality will take a number ‘n’ find its factorial and return the
answer that is what it is doing So let me I have to use this functionality I have define the
functionality now I am going to use this functionality so let me take an input sorry input
input generally takes in terms of strings in Mac so I need to type cast into int this is a Mac
dependency that’s it it may differ from operating system to operating system with practice
you will get to know how your operating system expects your input syntax to be based on
that you please modify this I am doing this with correspondent to Mac so I am type casting it
I am typing it the input let me say enter the number I will get a number but see factorial is
defined only for positive numbers for negative numbers factorial is not defined in
mathematically factorial is only defined for positive numbers If the number zero is given
what is the case if zero factorial has been defined as one that is the mathematical definition
that is why see I had defined the product as one in case if I given zero for I in range one
comma one so it will not at all go inside the loop it will directly return the value of one here
so this is like a dual advantage sort of thing zero factorial is one also one is the number with
which you multiply any number you will get back the same number so these are the research
why we started off with the initial product value with one here Ok you can start give zero but
not any negative number I will enter a positive number so let me give a clear message enter a
positive number I am asking you to enter a positive number if the user still enters the negative
number we should be smart enough and we should not allow this input so I should check it if
‘n’ is less than zero that is it is a negative number I should display the message that factorial
is not defined on negative numbers on negative numbers see why we are doing this is this is
what we call as fault tolerant major if the user has mistake given the some input which is
actually incorrect we should not throw at him some random search and terrify him we should
give him a polite message so that he can understand what mistake he has done he will not
repeat it so this I one of the software engineering principle we are following if ‘n’ is less than
zero you that is it is a negative number say that factorial is not defined on negative numbers
else let me say factorial so let me say f for factorial I will get back the answer I will call
factorial of ‘n’ so I had called the factorial of ‘n’ so it will return an answer right that answer
be captured in f so now I have to print it So let me print it print let me say factorial of ‘n’ is f
that is ‘n’ factorial is ‘f’ that is what we wanted to be printed So let me save the code let me
run it or maybe I will give you a brief info it will take an input it will check if it is a negative
number for negative numbers since mathematically factorial is not defined we display the
message that it is not define if it is a positive number it will start computing the factorial
how factorial is computer is You start off from the number one and keep multiplying the
consecutive numbers till you reach the given number n at the end of this multiplication
whatever is your answer is what you call as the factorial so you return that particular product
and you print it here factorial of n is this you are printing it this is how the working is let us
execute the programme let me run it ok it is asking me to enter a positive number let me
show you let me enter a negative number see factorial is not defined on negative number so
this particular thing is fine ok so let me run again with the correct input positive input let me
give a number six ok factorial of six is seven two one into two into three into four into five
into six is seven twenty that is what is displayed as the answer here fine So our programme
works fine this is not the only way to calculate factorial there is another way as well so you
can understand that way for that please do observe the solution try try enumerating running
programme on different inputs you will find some pattern if you are able to crack the pattern
you will understand the alternative way of calculating the factorial Thanks for watching till
now have a nice day
Alright guys you had seen iterative version this version where we use the loop to find
something is called the iterative version the iterative version that is we are repeating
something again and again this version is what you called as iterative version so we have
seen the iterative version of finding the factorial in the previous programming screen cast I
have told you to observe the solution you could find some patters I hope you would have
found some patterns using that patterns we will solve the factorial problem here in yet
another technique what we call as recursion so recursion is nothing but a technique in which
the programming languages allow a function to call itself again it may sound confusing at the
beginning but as you go it will be rally very easy so see as I had said if you want to compute
the factorial of four one into two the product is two ok then the next time when you approach
three the product till now is two two into three you compute is six the product till now is six
six into four is twenty four that is how you got the answer right and observe that you need
four factorial you were making use of the values of three factorial that is one into two into
three the values is six is being used to compute four factorial and you need three factorial you
were using the values of two factorial so there is a dependency between these values so when
you need larger values you are requiring a smaller value to compute the larger value so there
were so dependency so the n factorial dependent on n minus one factorial this was the general
pattern you could observe from the solutions mathematically also there is yet another
definition of this is one definition of n factorial so one into two into three into till n another
definition of n factorial is n into n minus one factorial so for n minus one factorial what
would you do N into n minus one into n minus two factorial so ultimately if you keep
expanding where would you stop As I had said zero factorial is one so that is where we stop
if you hit zero you will say I have reached the n so one is the answer here so till now
whatever has been multiplied multiply one to it that is nothing but by multiplying one answer
won’t change so we have reached the answer so zero marks the end of this procedure here
that is here we are depending on a smaller value for a larger value competition this process
stops at the point zero right so that place where we stop we call as the base case or the
anchor case I would write it here probably base case here I will use the green colour because
this appears ok so this is the multicolour command basically this appear in green colour it
would be easier I guess base case or the anchor case we can call it this is nothing but point
where your recursion recursion is nothing but your dependency on something of the same
type that is factorial of n is a computation it depends on factorial of n minus one how is that
computtered The same way Again you apply the same formula n minus one into factorial of
n minus two so you are basically doing the same thing but every time you do it again you are
doing it on a smaller number so then you multiply one into two into three up to hundred if
you multiply up to ten then use it to find eleven then use it to find twelve you are basically
break it into smaller things and solving it so when you do that that particular process where
the bigger thing was depending on something similar smaller instance of it a bigger value of n
depended on the similar kind of thing of a smaller value right the similar factorial
computation is similar three factorial depended on two factorial two is a smaller value
compare to three so something like it n depends on n minus one n minus one intern depends
on n minus two this chain of dependency how this is being that this process is called as
recursion A function calling itself with a smaller instance is what you call as recursion So if
it keeps calling at some point it has to stop calling here we have to say that ok we have hit
the answer we have arrived at the answer we have to say that This particular point what you
call as base case or the anchor case point where the recursion stops so this is what you call as
the anchor case so let me modify this functionality this particular thing is not being used here
this is the iterative version iterative version now let me start off with the recursive version
recursive version as I had said that factorial of n can be represented as n into factorial of n
minus one this is yet another way of defining the factorial function mathematically so this
particular way we are going to use here so where will it start Factorial of zero is equal to one
what if negative number occurs They won’t occur because here we are taking care of it if
negative numbers have been given as an input we don’t even call the functionality we are
calling it only on zero or greater than zero only so here we may not worry about handling
negative numbers because in the actual calling part we had handled it so we are not worrying
here ok this thing we are going to say so first the first step in recursion is always putting the
base case base case here base case was factorial of zero is one so I should say if we have
passed the number as n n is equal to zero I should return the product as such right so let me
bring use this statement the product is initially set to one right this is not needed actually I
can even remove this I can directly say return one so I should return one so I had return one
that is factorial of zero is one that is why id n is zero I returned one else what should I do I
should return n into n minus one factor n into n minus one factorial so I should call it as
factorial of n minus one ok let me give you illustration before we actually run the code so if I
call factorial of three let suppose let start with a smaller value so that it is easier you can
extend it for any value even factorial of hundred anything you can extend that’s not an issue
ok so how it begins is it will first check if n is zero three it is not equal to zero so it will come
to the else part it will see three into factorial of two so value of factorial of three depends on
the value of factorial of two similar instance but the value inside is smaller ok so now this
particular thing has to be called ok factorial of two gets called so again see factorial of two so
two is passed here n is equal to zero no two is not equal to zero so its comes here it will say
two into sorry two into factorial of one ok so now factorial of one gets called ok what is
factorial of one gets called so one is passed here if one equal equal to zero so false come
back to else return one into factorial of n minus one so it will compute one into sorry factorial
of one minus one is zero ok so now ok factorial of zero zero is passed here n equal to zero
zero equal to zero its true so it will return one so this will return one so now your calculation
will go in the upward direction ok let me show you the upward calculation ok so one is
returned so it goes one level up one level up so it will calculate one into one what is the
answer one so that particular value is passed to one level up ok so two into what is the value
being passed there one so that is being calculated so two into one is calculated two into one
this one there is a passed from one level below for it there is passed from one level below so
the computation breaks down into smaller numbers and once you get the number where you
get the where you know the answers you trace back till you get the larger answer that is how
we are working here ok so two into one is two ok let me now say let me now say so two has
been passed here already it was having three three into two three into two ok what is the
answer Six so this thing has found it so it will get the answer has six so this answer will be
passed on to the main function value we have called this so when you call factorial of three it
will keep splitting the problems into smaller ones until it knows the answer and once you
know the answer trace in the backward direction till you get the answer for the larger problem
this is how recursion works ok this is the Woking of recursion let us start a new console and
let us run it ok before that I have to save this I will save ok let the console start ok so it has
started so let me run the file enter a positive number the same negativity check all these are
the same so I am not giving a negative number so let me give back as positive number let me
say five factorial of five is one twenty so in a similar fashion it will break down five will
break down to four four will break down to three three to two two to one one to zero for
zero you know the answer now use that answer trace in the backward direction and you will
get the answer as one twenty So this is how the recursive programme work I hope you have
understand the concept here or it’s not a difficult thing it’s a easier one all that you need is
some practice that’s it take some examples you try thinking in this fashion try breaking into
smaller pieces then once you get the answer try constructing back the actual answer So I
hope you have been remembering the movie clip that has been shown at the beginning of the
video the person would ask answer for something to a person before him the thing keeps on
propagating till someone who knows the answer once you get the answer you propagate in
the backward direction to the person who has asked the question in this case what is the
factorial of three That is the question asked by your main function that is question asked by
your sir so you cannot compute it directly so you try splitting it into a smaller instance so
that is something analogue us to asking the person before him whether he knows so whether
this thing can be calculated it checks even this cannot be calculated so again split this is can
be calculated no so again split can this be calculated Yes calculate use the answer and
propagate in the backward direction I guess now you understand why we had shown the
movie clip and also how the concept of recursion works this is really a very powerful
concept in computer science it will make it institutive things be easier to code that is
something will be intuitive for us we will have in mind that this is how things has to be done
But how you would translate it into a code It may be difficult if only iteration value for
rescue recursion is handy in many situation you would come across as you keep learning
some advance stuff even in some stuff what you had learned till now you can have a recursive
version for some problems please note that for this we had an iterative version as well as a
recursive version so for every recursive version there is an equalent iterative version too so
you can use anything that is convenient for you and in some places recursion is highly
intuitive and easy on minds so once such application will see in the next video Thanks for
watching have a nice day Alright guys hope you had learnt about the powerful technique of
recursion I hope you remember search algorithm that you had studied previously in your
previous weeks namely the binary search let me give you a very quick overview of what is
does It is basically how we search for in a dictionary or in a telephone directory something
like that Why did I take dictionary or telephone directory Because the words or the contents
in the directory are sorted or that is arranged in some ascending order they are arranged in the
alphabetical order so that is why we can apply this technique so binary search basically calls
for a sorted list you want a list that is arranged in some specific order either ascending or
descending it calls for list arranged in their order and in that list you want to see whether a
particular number is present in the list or not whether a particular item is present in the list or
not so what would you do You would check the middle of the list if that is your required
item you are done else you check if it is less than your required number or greater than your
required number accordingly you will branch on to the left half of the list or the right half of
the list So this is how your binary search works you have seen a iterative version of binary
search in your previous weeks I guess so that is easier but still an easier thing like how I had
given you an intuitive version of binary search like you have to scan into the left half and you
have to scan into the right half something like that I had given you an intuitive version so
such a intuitive thing can be easily translated to code when you use this technique of
recursion so let us see how we can use recursion through simplify the process of writing code
for binary search Let me say I will define binary search binary search define binary search
for this I need list or you can call it list l I need a list l some element x which we want to find
you were processing it by sing the index values you would have seen that till now you may
be familiar but still I am telling you a very quick recap indexes in computers starts from zero
human start counting from one cut computers start counting from zero so the counting starts
from zero so if your list has five elements the counting would be done as zero one two three
four zeroth element first element second element third element fourth element this is how
your computer counts so you have to give the starting index and the ending index these are
required for your binary search right so initially your starting index is zero ending index is
actual end of your list so that is entire list then as you scan the middle element you keep
discarding one half of the list and just keep searching in the other half so that time it will
change so these are the Para things you need to do binary search you need a list you need the
element x which you want to search you need a start and end index of the list where you want
that is you won’t search the entire list all the time you will search parts of list by discarding
the unnecessary half this is how your binary search works so we needed this four parameters
ok let me define as I had said recursion requires base case what is the base case When we
have only one element left in our list if just one element is left in our list then we have to see
that particular element if that is the required element then you say yes required element has
been found else you say element is not found ok so for element not found I am going to
return value minus one I am going to assume that my list has all positive values and minus is
not the value in my list also I am going to return the position of the element I am not going to
return the element even if have negative element I don’t mind let’s find I am going to return
the binary search basically here I am going to return the position in which the element is
present at the list so that is what I am going to return so position starts from zero right so if
the element is not found I will return minus one that is the element is found somewhere
outside the list that’s what basically I mean so I will return minus one in case if it is not
found so base case is the base case is one element just one element in the list that is the base
case so if there is just one element in the list how would you start and end they would be
equal start and end will be the same value because there is only one element that is the start
as well that is the end so I will start using the start and end indices if start is equal to end I
would check if l of start or end you can use anything inter change of it because they both are
equal in this case if that are equal to your required element x you return the start value that
is return that position hence there is just one element say suppose assume you have just one
element ten in your list and what you want to search is fifty fifty is not present in the list and
it is having only one element then you have to say element not found so for that I said the
code I am going to use encoding I am going to use is minus one so I will return minus one
element fifty is present in the minus oneth position meaning that it is not present ok so I will
return minus one in that case ok so this is the base case if the base case is not true then else
that is there are more elements in a list in that case you have to find the middle element and
you have to discard the unnecessary half and search through the required half you have to
split the array into halves and search through the required half that is what you have to do
right so divide the divide the array into halves this thing we have to do for that we need to
find the mid position mid position is nothing but start plus end here I have to put up bracket
because I need to calculate the sum first then I have to divide by two this is the midpoint right
this is intuitive start and so here will be your start and here will be your end the midpoint will
be start plus end divide by two this will be your midpoint when you divide there is a
possibility that you can get some value that is floating point may be seven by two three point
five what is the meaning for position three point five Either you have to take it to three or to
four so for that we are using a functionality int so we are type casting it to integer because
position is a integer we want it in a integer that is first position second position third position
this is what we want we don’t want three point five position so will use int so it will have its
own conversion it will take it to three point five to three or four maybe we can run here and
check int of three point five let me give three so it is taking to floor functionality floor is
nothing but the integer that is closest to it the greatest value of the integer that is closest to it
if we take the number line three point five is somewhere here three is here and four is here it
is going to the left side so int functionality is going to the left side and taking the greatest
integer two one everything is present in the left but the greatest in the left the integer is three
so three is returned as the answer So that will be taken here let me start a new console better
because for this program new console ok so this is the midpoint we have computed we have
to check mid element is the required element so if the if l of mid is equal to x that is the case
we have done we have found the element return the mid element else I have to check if it is
greater or less so I would say l of mid is greater than x means you have a sorted list and the
middle element is greater than your required element so where should you search definitely
your element will not be in your right half you can discard the right half and you need to
search the left half so your array would now shrink from the starting position to mid minus
one so mid position didn’t have the element also there is no chance that it will be after mid so
it would be before mid so we need to shrink the array up till mid minus one position that is
one position before the mid till that we need to shrink the array that is we will do as return
the result of binary search on the same list for the same element x start position is not change
see because we are we have to check the left half of the array so the start position is the same
but the end position is not the precious end position previously we have the bigger list we
want to split it so the end is mid minus one why mid minus one Because at mid position we
had checked at mid position didn’t contain the element ‘x’ so an ‘x’ is the smaller value that
is ‘x’ is l of mid is greater than x meaning that x is lesser than l of mid so ‘x’ being less than
the mid value will be present in the left half so from starting position till one position before
mid whatever is the array left search in that array and return the answer if what we mean see
it is really intuitive see this is the left half this is the left half than using of iterative method
recursion is easy you can translate your intuition into code very easily if you use the recursive
ideology ok so this is the recursive way to call the left half of the array call the procedure on
the left half of the array search the left half else you have to search the right half so for the
right half end value is the same but starting point is different right we had searched till mid
we didn’t find it at the position mid and the value x is greater than the mid value so it would
be present from one anywhere from one position after mid up till the actual end point right so
your start value will change or I would say return binary search result on l x mid plus one
and end the modify starting point is mid plus one till mid position we had checked there was
no element that is why we are checking the path after the midpoint here we are checking the
path after the midpoint here we are checking the path before the midpoint that is the left half
and the right half whatever we had it intuitively in our mind we are translating it to code very
easily so this is the power of the recursion so it would recursively keep computing and we
will get the answer so you can take any example I had given you an example of how
recursion works in the factorial screen cast similar to that you take a list you try applying
binary search on it you try how recursion works you would have understood how recursion
works so this particular search the bigger list depends on the value of searching on the
smaller list so whatever the result you get after searching on smaller list will be translated
back and will be returned as the result for searching on a bigger list this is how your binary
search in the recursive manner so we had defined binary search now we have to used it right
so let me give a random list you can also change it with your version you ask the user to input
how many numbers he want to input you input that many number of numbers or till he
presses some keys you keep getting input you can by now I guess you all are familiar with the
various conditional construes using that you can modify the code as you wish now my motto
is to demonstrate binary search so I would just give a smaller list twenty forty five sixty
seventy ninety this is my list I have given please note that I have given a list in the sorted
order if it is not sorted you have to apply sorting first then after you get the sorted list then
you have pass the sorted list to the binary search binary search expects the sorted list so that
is very important please make a note of it so this is my list and I will input the x value from
the user ok let me input the value of ‘x’ from the user and I have to typecast the input in my
Mac machine so I am type casting you please follow as per your machine dependency input
enter search key search key I would say that is what number you want to search I would
input the search key from the user that is my ‘x’ so binary search will return the index and so
let me store it as index is equal to binary search on the list l search key ‘x’ starting position is
always zero for the bigger list initially we start with the entire list zero and the end position is
zero to length minus one this is the five element list so it will be four so let me generalise it
so let me say length of l this will give the length of the list that is how many elements are
present in a list will be return by this length of the list minus one this is the ending index so
you initially start of your search with this particular index this is the suppose my search key is
eighty this will be the entire key is passed so it would find the mid value sixty it is righty is
greater than sixty so this half is not needed this is neglected and this particular thing will be
executed and seventy ninety this will be my new list in this list I will search for my key
seventy and ninety this will be taken as the mid value as we have seen that floor value is
taken so this value is taken as mid value eighty is still greater than seventy so it will skip to
the right half so here there is only one element ninety so this case would be executed ninety is
not equal to eighty so it will return minus five so I will come to know that this thing is not
present so something like that it works you can trace through it I hope now you are clear with
how recursion works and you are clear with the binary search concept too so you can
understand it you all that you need is take a pen and paper and trace through how some
example work that is what is required with that you can easily understand the concept ok so
it will return the index where the element is present in the list ok I have got the index so if I
just say the index this is not enough for a normal user for us element sixty is present at the
third position if I say two they will say what is this computers doesn’t know even this so we
have to translate it into a human friendly format right so basically what is that we have to do
we have to add one one is represented as zero the index in second position is index one
third position is index two so basically whatever is the index it returns add one to it and
display it to the user and if it returns minus one you should not say it is present in the zero
you should say that element is not found print appropriate message so first we will give a
check that if index is equal to minus one in that case you should print x value not found ok x
value is not found ok else you should print that is minus one is the not the case that you
should print that x value is found at found at position index plus one computers counting
system and the humans counting system differ by one that’s why we are adding one and
display ok so this is how you have done let me save the code I hope you are clear with it we
have a list we input a search key this you can even modify it to getting the input for the list
element is from the user you have to sort the list please note that you have to send a sorted
list for binary search to occur so you have to sort that list input a search key then you apply
binary search on it how it works If there is just one element in the list it will check if that
element is the required x element x if it is the case it will return the index else it will return
minus one so whenever the element is not found it will return minus one that is how we have
encoded it In case if the list have more than one element what it does is it will find the mid
element and based on the mid element since the array is sorted it will discard one of the
halves if the element required is exactly the mid element we are done if it is less than the mid
element you have to search the left half so it will discard the right half it will search only the
left half if it is greater you have to search only the right half it will discard the left half so for
this to understand this really well I would suggest that you take a twenty element list
basically and you try tracing it on paper basically to understand this clearly you should work
out a lot on papers and less on computers computers can do this in fraction of second but
humans to understand this strategy it requires some practice so please take a pen and paper
take some twenty element list randomly you sort it maybe for that you can use the computers
as well because sorting a twenty element list may take some time so you can use the
computer as well you sort it or you take the sorted list of the twenty elements you randomly
give some search element you give some element which is present in the list as well as some
element which is not present in the list try to understand how the various runs of the
programs are and you will really understand the process very easily after practice all that
need is needed is practice please do practice practice practice that’s it now let us run this
program let me run it ok it is asking me to enter a search key let me enter eighty eighty not
found perfect! Ok now let me enter ninety let me enter ninety ninety is found at position five
perfect We got it when I entered eighty eighty not found at this list so it’s says eighty not
found and when you enter ninety ninety is found here it is found at position five so it says
ninety is found at position five so it works I would recommend that please you take some
pen and paper and work through the various example work through list with large elements
as well here just that I wanted to demonstrate the recursion technique I had taken a smaller
list and already sorted list you try different things unsorted list you sort it then apply binary
search at huge list a list where you get somewhere it is if it is a twenty element list try to find
the sixth seventh element try to find the eighteenth element try to find something exactly near
middle or near the middle something like that you try various possibilities you will
understand actually what is logic of binary search how it works all that is needed is practice
with pen and paper Keep practicing thanks for watching have a nice day
Alright guys hope you had seen a few examples of our recursion work this is yet another
mathematical function or mathematical sequence I would say which can be easily computed
using recursion So this is what we call as the Fibonacci sequence let me give you some
explanations in commands before we start off with the coding So we are going to see what is
called the Fibonacci sequence I guess you guys are familiar with it still let me give you a
brief overview so the Fibonacci sequence starts with zero and one this is the zeroth Fibonacci
sequence same like computers it here the counting starts from zero zeroth Fibonacci
sequence is zeroth Fibonacci number is zero let me write one by one that’s better zeroth
Fibonacci number is zero sorry I am sorry for this zeroth Fibonacci number is zero the first
Fibonacci number is one second Fibonacci number is nothing but now you have got two
numbers let me put it ok given that you have got two numbers you add this two numbers and
you got the result has zero plus one is one so this is your second Fibonacci number The third
Fibonacci number is nothing but add the last two one plus one two two is your answer the
fourth Fibonacci number is one plus two three three is your answer the fifth Fibonacci
number is three plus two five this is your answer and so on and keeps going keeps on going it
is a infinite sequence basically The initial two values are nothing but the seed values they
had given these are the in our recursion terminology this is the base case or the anchor case
this is the base case or the anchor case for these two things we know the value we can
directly written the value you can directly say this is the value they say I won the first
Fibonacci number they can directly say first Fibonacci number is one if someone is asking
you the tenth Fibonacci number something like that you don’t know you need to calculate it
so using zero and one you find two using one and two you find three using two and three
you find four so do you see a bigger value of the Fibonacci number that is the nth Fibonacci
number depends on the value of n minus one Fibonacci number plus n minus two Fibonacci
number so it depend on the previous two values right so here we can apply recursion and we
can easily find the nth Fibonacci number so our objective here is to find the nth Fibonacci
number Fibonacci number we can have the iteration of the code too but in this case I would
leave the iterative version of the Fibonacci number as an exercise for you guys please do try
it it is not very easy it requires some amount of thinking but it’s not herculean task something
like it it’s not rocket science it is do able so you need to invest some amount of time you
invest some amount of thinking if you do that you can find iterative way how to find the
Fibonacci number so that I would leave it as an exercise I would demonstrate the recursive
way for you Ok so let us start off I need to define Fibonacci I would say Fibonacci of n nth
Fibonacci number is what I want to find I know the zeroth Fibonacci number and first
Fibonacci number zeroth Fibonacci number is zero first number is one so in this case I need
to return if given n is zero I need to return zero if the given n is one I need to return one so if
n is zero or one I need to return back n itself so that is my base case ok that is why I had
given a space here as well this is the base case and maybe I will put a dash here this is the
base case and this are derived from the base numbers ok so this is the base case so let me first
put it if n is less than two and similar to that the negative value of n Fibonacci is not defined
we need to check that in the main part where we are calling this functionality same as
factorial how it is defined just for positive numbers and zero zero and positive numbers
Fibonacci is also defined only from zero for negative numbers it is not defined so let me say
zero and one right so let me say n is less than two just return back that n if it is zero return
zero if it is one return one so like that n ok else if it is greater than or equal to two from two
onwards we are dependent on the previous values so you should return back the Fibonacci of
n minus one plus Fibonacci of n minus two maybe you want the second Fibonacci number
you should return Fibonacci of two minus one that is Fibonacci of one plus Fibonacci of zero
that is what we calculated Fibonacci of one is one Fibonacci of zero is zero so that is the
first Fibonacci number is one zeroth Fibonacci number is zero so zero plus one one that is
how we calculated right so that is what we are doing you take the previous two Fibonacci
numbers and add it is what you are doing if you need the third one what you do is second
plus first first one you know the value so substitute one Fibonacci number second Fibonacci
number you don’t know so you calculate second Fibonacci number plus one for getting
second Fibonacci number again you call it for second it is first plus zeroth so zeroth plus one
is one one plus one is two so you will get the third Fibonacci number so you can trace it on a
paper and you will understand the working so this is how basically Fibonacci numbers work
if it is less than two just return back the same value otherwise return back the sum of previous
two values right This is the intuitive way of explaining Fibonacci numbers see we have
translated our institution we have translated the intuition into code very easily all thanks to
recursion with this powerful technique we can really made this code very very easier but for
iterative version you can write an iterative version I don’t say that with iterative version it is
totally impossible you can write an iterative version but it requires some amount of thinking
invested here ok so I have got the answer so I should take an input n is equal to integer input
what I wanted so I will type cast for because of my machine dependency I type cast input
enter the positive maybe I can say or non negative that is because zero is also defined right!
so I should say non even in factorial please make the correction there it is non negative
because zero factorial is one also defined so enter an non negative number enter a non
negative number is the input is the message I got so and from input I will get still I need to
check in case that person has by mistake entered an negative number I shouldn’t throw at him
some some results that is incorrect so I should throw him I should tell him the suitable
message properly so I will print undefined for negative numbers n is less than zero means that
it is a negative number whatever input he has given what is undefined Fibonacci number is
undefined for negative numbers Ok so I will say Fibonacci numbers are undefined for
negative numbers ok so I had given it Fibonacci numbers are undefined for negative numbers
else if it is not a negative number than I should print the nth nth Fibonacci nth is not correct
because we gives first second I have to put st and nd here properly so that formatting is
needed I would modify the message instead smartly Fibonacci number at position sorry it is
position n is I should call Fibonacci of n alright I hope you guys can understand this till now
see I take a number input a non negative number zero or positive I agree if it is a negative
number I will say it is not it is undefined I print this message else I call this functionality
Fibonacci or n ok if I call this functionality Fibonacci or n if that number is less than two for
zeroth Fibonacci number is zero first Fibonacci number is one so this is something defined as
the base case for us so in that case I will return the value of n otherwise I will compute the
sum of previous two Fibonacci numbers right so this will input the nth Fibonacci number so
for first let me verify further let me enter five if I enter five I should get five as the answer or
maybe enter four I should get three as my answer let me verify it first then maybe I will find
the other Fibonacci numbers ok let me run the file ok enter an non negative number I will
enter so just for verification I enter minus seven Fibonacci numbers are undefined for
negative numbers yeah! I got the proper message ok now let me test it if I enter four the
fourth Fibonacci number is three I should get three as my answer let me run it enter a non
negative number let me enter three sorry four fourth Fibonacci number is three third
Fibonacci number is two fine you can do it Let me enter four Fibonacci number at position
four is three yeah it is working so now let me find out the tenth Fibonacci number let me do
tenth Fibonacci number Fibonacci number at position ten is fifty five maybe you can list the
numbers like this and you can verify but its correct so once its working here definitely it will
work for many value so using this program you can find the Fibonacci number at the nth
position in the sequence in the Fibonacci sequence what is the number present at the nth
position so here nth is luckily this is one thing in mathematic which is very close to computer
science counting starts from zero so nth number is nothing but for humans counting style n
plus oneth number pleas have that in mind here counting starts from zero I would
recommended you guys invest some time thinking if you can do this in an iterative fashion it
requires some amount of thinking to make it iterative it is possible it can be done but it is not
straight forward it requires some amount of thinking so when you invest some time for
thinking in the iterative style you would definitely appreciate the technique recursion because
it’s lets you do something straight away from your intuition whatever you understand from
someone explanation you can straight away try staring the code recursion allows that thing
that particular thing is difficult when you do it in the iterative way but still it’s not a rocket
science it’s doable please do invest some amount of time try doing the iterative version and
please do discuss in the discussion form of how you tried the iterative version what are the
challenges you faced Or if you can print the sequence Fibonacci sequence if they are asking
the nth Fibonacci number can you print the sequence starting from zero till the nth Fibonacci
number can you try that variation You can do a lot of things pleased do explore and keep
trying more examples so that you understand how recursion actually works Thanks for
watching have a nice day Six that will be one two three four five and six You will get
another chance oh! Six oh oh ok right one that’s a one you are on thirty seven that perfect
four one two three and four So the game that we are playing is called snake and ladders the
game again involves a whole a lot of randomness and there is no place for logic or thinking
so the idea is very simple you start with two pawns as you can see I am red and she is blue
we start with one and this is a dice where I roll and then if it’s five I start with keeping I start
keeping five so let’s say for example we both are here and I roll this it is two and one two and
then she rolls can you roll bhawana It’s three and she puts three and whenever we encounter
a ladder we climb up and whenever we encounter a snake a snake bites you see we come
down to its tale and then continue you see assuming I climb up like this and finally come here
finally come in here just in case I put two from here the snake bites and I may have to come
down to twenty three so that’s the rule of the game the point is anyone who reaches hundred
wins the game So bhawana where were we I think I was eighty one you were on eighty one
I was on eighty seven ok yah perfect and I should I play maybe I play once more I think you
were about to getting bite by snakes so let’s go but I was explaining the game I think I should
get a second choice No no I don’t think in this game you will get a second choice hey come
on I am not a cheater cock so let’s continue from here one two ok fine I will accept that it was
two!
You saw this game it has very simple rules anybody can follow it and start playing it
immediately so what you do is you roll a dice and move your pawn accordingly assume you
are on let’s say fifteen number fifteen you roll a dice and you get a five which means your
pawn moves sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty and twenty in case if it’s a snake you
come down a few units if it’s a ladder you going up a few units so this game is very popular
all over the world although it originated in India it is now very well known in different parts
of the world and there are variants for this game as well so that aside we will now see how we
can write a piece of code to stimulate this game where two people can simply sit in front of
their computer and then play so a word of advice since you people are beginning to code you
needn’t worry s o much about doing the exact stimulation putting a board and displaying a
snake and ladder may not be required let us do it with playing text Let’s see how this can be
done
Alright we just now saw favourite game of most of us in childhood snake and ladder being
played by two persons now let us play using a computer programme Hello all welcome to
the programming screen cast of snake and ladder in this programming screen cast I will take
you down your memory lane where you had played one of the favourite games of I guess
almost most of you in your childhood namely the snake and ladders snake and ladder the
board would generally consist of numbers from one to hundred arranged in a ten cross ten
grid there would be snakes in some point and ladder in some points ladder would generally
take you up the board that is from lower point to a higher point and snakes would generally
takes you down the board from higher point to a lower point this sort of symbolises theme of
life that life is full of ups and downs so this would be favourite game for many people
because if is somehow close to the real life scenario alright let us now see how we shall play
this game in a very cool manner using our python code through our computers Alright let’s
get started Before getting started with the code I will show you the image of a snake and
ladder board I had got an image from an internet this is here this is a snake and ladder board
as I had said there are numbers from one to hundred in an ten cross ten fashion there are
ladders somewhere as well as snakes somewhere I am sure you would have played this game
in your childhood this is just journey down the memory lane alright I would ask you guys to
please pause this video at this moment make a note of snakes and ladders in this board
various points from where to where is the transition of each ladder For example this
particular ladder starts at twenty one and takes you to eighty two and this particular snakes
starts at sixty four and this takes you to thirty six like that you please make a note of this
snakes and ladders by pausing the video this would be of greater interest to us during the
later part of our code please pause the video at this point and make a note of the snakes and
ladders alright I hope you would have paused and made a note of the snakes and ladders now
let’s get started with the coding part let me minimise this image let just started with the
coding part when someone plays the game what are the two things you suppose to do in the
computer someone is going to play the game you are suppose to show him the board I call
that as show board functionality the next is he is suppose to play the players are supposed to
play and the end point of the snake and ladder we have to define this snake and ladder this
board has end point at hundred hundred is the winning position when some player reaches
hundred first he is considered as the winner two players would play and the one who reaches
hundred first is consider to have won the game till than the game will proceed in case the
player wants to bought in the middle he can totally quit the game if the players continuously
proceed hundred is considered as the winning position this is how we are going to configure
our game here so as I said first you are suppose to show the board to the players then you
have to ask them to play this is the higher level abstraction details and this is considered to be
good programming practice that has to you have to abstract as much as possible like see a
person who wants just an higher level overview he would read this he would understand the
entire point is hundred and you are suppose to show the board and play the person is suppose
to play this is what the game expects someone to do so this is the higher level overview so
this is considered to be a good programming practice to give a higher level overview your
code must be organised such that by reading these overview the person should be able to get
the higher level idea of what your code will do and if they want to del deep into the code then
you may allow them into del deep into it but for a person who just need high level overview
he should not be made to go through the final details unnecessarily this is considered to be a
good programming practice for this purpose we are using different functions and another use
of functions is reusability if you want to repeatedly do something and if you want to reuse
that the if you want to use the same functionality at various places then functions come to
your rescue they greatly help in reusability so it is very good programming practice to use
functions as much as possible and the higher level overview must be easily obtained for any
one so the naming of functions also I recommend that you give such that it is easily
understandable by someone it is also the syntactically it is corrective you can say f one f two f
three function f f one f two f three and so on but it doesn’t give the overview of what is the
function may contains some twenty thirty lines of code or may be more than that as well as an
how the requirement is for the code may grow longer and longer that maybe there but to
understand what that particular function say f one is doing you have to go through those
hundreds of lines of codes and understand this is not good programming practice so to
facilitate that a good practice is to name the function accordingly suppose the function is in
calculating the matrix multiplication say just for example I am using it matrixes have got
nothing to do with this game now I am just giving an example suppose the function is
performing matrix multiplication you are suppose to name it as matrix multiply that is a good
convention so that just by the name the person who needs a higher level overview can get it
without getting deep into the code so this is the good practice please make a note of it and use
functions as much as possible because it simplifies your work greatly alright so now let’s gets
started with it we have to get deep into the functions show board and play are the two
functionalities and now I need to say what this show board has to do so let me close this
image now I don’t think it is needed let me close this because in show board I am suppose to
open the image again show board functionality this is the functionality this is a image file so
I have to import the image library from the package PIL input image library this is how I have
imported the image library so let me now open the image img is the object that captures the
image image dot open here you are suppose to give the file path where the image file is
present in my case it is present in the same directory as that of my code so I am just giving
the file name in case you have stored your image in a different path please do specify the
complete path so that the image shall be opened alright now once the image is opened it has
to be shown so I will say image dot show this open show all these are pre defined functions in
the image library and as you would see as I had said they had given the names such that you
can understand what it does what it does image dot show there will be a lot of
transformations involved in showing from as you know computers deal every in terms of
binaries zero and ones from that to a image that is understandable by humans to transform
there are a lot of steps involved but all these are abstracted at what we know is if you say
show it will show the image so that is enough for us we need not del deep into the binary
level information so in this way your functions must be named open show all these are self
explanatory what this particular thing is going is clearly understandable just by this so htis is
the show board functionality currently I am not going to code for play so let me command it
but this will also be an important step so I have return it and command it and once show
board works will go with play let us we had written the code for show board let us see if the
board is being shown then we will go with the next functionality play I will save this file and
I will run this see the image is shown so this is the image that is that has been shown also the
board will be shown so this functionality works fine no problem with this let me close this
now and ok the next thing is we have to go with this particular functionality play we will see
what are the other functionalities required in play if it requires any other functionalities or
any other libraries has to be imported as and when we del deep into we import and we will
define new functions we will make the code more readable and if you just give this code
probably to your maybe younger sibling maybe ten twelve years old sibling who barely
understands English that person just by seeing the names would be able to understand what
are the checks that are being performed how the flow of programming is everything would
be very clear we will make it in such a way we will modularised this program this particular
process is called modularisation like you split the you split the single units of tasks into
chunks like show board this is one particular task I have made it once chunk and play is one
chunk the play consist of some sub chunks we are making the functionalities into chunks so
that anyone can get the higher level overview even test it someone who just understand
English with the names they would be able to understand what is the flow of the program
you may check that alright we have done with show board functionality let us go into play
functionality
Alright guys in the previous video you would have seen the method of show board the
functionality I had mentioned here I had written the code board for functionality so that the
board is shown to the player now what is pending is the play functionality let us see what is
needed in play functionality ok I had commander it back then because I want you to show
that show board functionality works so now play is require so I will remove the ash so that its
now no longer a command and now we want play functionality to find play here as I said in
this game we having two players p one and p two let us save them p one will have some name
because we want to have it as personalised interface it should not just be like player one
player two he had got a sweet name we need to refer to him by it by his name then he will be
very very happy so we need to refer to him by his name and lets input his name from him lets
input his name input is taken by this functionality raw input we are inputting a string so it is
taken by raw input string is nothing but a set of characters names generally consists if
characters right so that is what technically we call it as string this is a string so we use raw
input functionality to input strings so this is the message that has to be displayed what should
we be displaying Maybe we shall say player one please enter your name looks good alright
the same has to be done to player two as well instead of typing it again let me copy and paste
this and do the modifications wherever needed it is player two’s name and it is player two so
the first would be inputting the player one’s name and then inputting player two’s name so let
me command that as well for completion sake input player one name this is input player two
name why do we have commands is To help us understand the code at later point of time
Maybe when you are doing this now maybe you will find it later easier but once you have
done sufficient number of exercises and when you want to look back at what you had done
previously that time there may be some confusions so to avoid that we have commands where
we write in English format that is understandable by us we can look back to the commands
and then get to know the syntax that has been used and all that it would be easier for our
revision if needed so that is why we are using commands alright so initially both are starting
at that is they don’t have their they have their dice placed on the floor not on the board so
they will roll the dice based on what the number appears they will place it on the snake and
ladder board so ground let me denote it by point zero player one has points zero this is
nothing but I will command this as well initial points of player one player one has got point
zero alright Ok the same as to be repeated for player two so let me copy and paste it this is
for player two so I will just give a summary of this four lines we input player ones name the
same we do it for player two then we have set the initial points of both the players to zero and
there will be one variable it will denote whose turn it is let me initialise it with zero you can
initialise it one as well but in computers generally the counting starts from zero so I have
done it with zero but it is not mistake even if you start from one so the game will be played
continuously so let me say while one this is nothing but an infinite loop the game would be
played continuously so I have put an infinite loop here I guess most of you would have some
confusion here that I said when you reach the end points the game ends but here I am saying
the game will be played continuously how is that possible You would have it is not
contradicting this is a doubt you may have so it will become clear as the code proceeds there
is a check inside whether the end points has been reached or not if end point has been reached
then we will break this loop break this loop is nothing but we come out of the game that is
what we call as break this loop this is a infinite loop that will be broken that is the game
would end when you reach the end point the check would be perform at a later point alright
so turn zero is for player one so I would check turn zero is for player one turn one then I will
increase the value of turn by one and I will increment if by one so turn will become one turn
one will be for player two turn two will be again for player one turn three will be again for
player two so every turn is alternated so if you would observe the pattern here turn zero two
four six and so on for player one and turn one three five seven so on are for player two this
could be abstracted from this way that to take the value of turn you divide it by two and take
the reminder if that is zero that is the turn of player one otherwise it is the turn of player two
so to check the reminder we have the operator mod which is denoted by percentage we will
be using that now if turn mod two equals equal zero note that single equal to is assignment it
is nothing but you are assigning the value as zeros let the value be anything I don’t care I
want it to be zero then you have to use a single equal to here you have to check the equality I
don’t want to change the value I want to fetch that value I want to compare it with some
standard value in that case you have to use the double equal to symbol please note this point
ok if that is the if this is the turn then this is player ones turn player ones turn this is alright
this has to be notified to the player so I will print a message player ones name his name has to
be mentioned I will say your turn player one this is your turn a message has been put and I
had said the player may want to quit the game in the middle as well we have to give him this
options till you reach the points hundred I don’t want to I want to quit it even that option will
have to be given to him for that matlab this will give more personalised feeling that is why
we are giving this option as well that I will take it as his choice so c nothing but ask players
approval to continue asks players wish players choice let me say that as players choice to
continue this is what will be doing next let me call this as c c for choice or whether he wants
to continue you can take it anyway I will just call this c or you can name it as choice as well
that is up to you I am using c input see that was the function I was used previously the raw
input that was a specialised function to input strings nothing but something like name or your
address something like that to input that you will use raw input here I will ask one or zero one
will denote he wants to continue zero denotes he want to quit the game so I would input his
choice I will have to say him press one to continue and zero to quit so I will get his input if
his choice is zero if the choice is zero I will have to the scores and I will have to quit the
game so let me show the scores the points is stored in pp one and pp two pp one is the points
of player one pp two is points of player two First the player ones name has to be mentioned
player ones name quote here the points this has to be mentioned and the same thing has to be
done for player two as well so I am copying and pasting it player two points of player two
this is done you have to mention the points and you have to say quitting the game quitting
the game thanks for playing something like that just a humble message a message has been
displayed and now we have to come out of the loop that is this all these are for the user to
give a personalised experience to the user we are using all these print statements but what is
the instruction to be given to the computer to get out of the loop is this statement break break
statement will come out of the loop and it will end the game basically that’s what this will do
here and otherwise if choice is zero this would be executed if not it would just come here
observe the indents indentation is important here it is in the same level of if so if c equals
equals to zero this check would be made if the user hasn’t pressed zero that is he doesn’t want
to quit it would come directly to line number forty here which is in the same indent level here
you are suppose to roll a dice let me when you roll a dice you would get some number that let
me store it in a variable called dice so to roll a dice to stimulate this what happens is what
happens when you roll a dice some random number from one to six something from one to
six would come when you roll a dice so I to stimulate this what should I give the instruction
to the computer is you pick a random number from one to six to give this instruction I have to
use this random package random library has to be imported I will say import random this is
the library that is needed since we needed it we imported it here now I will say random dot
the functionality is randint this is the functionality randint this requires few to give the end
points that is what should be the start value and what should be the end value the start value
is one in our case and end value is six this particular functionality would generate a random
number from one two three four five six this is what this functionality is doing you generate
a random number this is basically stimulation of rolling a dice alright we have generated a
random number now you are suppose to display what was showed by the dice print dice
showed dice showed the points that is captured by this variables dice so dice showed this
point is printed to the user and now once this is once the dice has been rolled you have to add
that many number of points to your already already the points whatever you have to that you
must add this points so let us do that P one this variable p p one stores the points of player
one this is nothing whatever is the pint take it you add the value of dice so that will be your
new points and when you are playing the snake and ladder sometimes the it may happen that
when you reach some position there may be a snake or they may be a ladder so accordingly
your points will increase or decrease the change has to occur so to stimulate that let us say the
points one is nothing but you check if there is a ladder at this particular points if you think
why do I pass the same parameter here and here is this particular line what it does is it will
add the points add the points here I guess the name would clarifies so commands is not
needed but why do we pass this here and here I will explain this is the place where you have
landed after rolling the dice now you are suppose to check if that particular position has got a
ladder if that has got a ladder your points this particular value of this particular value of pp
one the points is no longer valid some higher points you would get so that higher value of
points would be stored here so that is why we are using same variable pp one in both the
cases I hope it is clear in it will be clear when we deal deep into this particular functionality
check ladder this may be a ladder a positive thing which will increase your points or it may
happened that it is a snake check if it is a snake of the same the same way check ladder and
check snake are two functionalities which we will define later these are the things that we
have to do and sometimes it may happen that in some points you are all at say ninety five you
are at position ninety five and your dice showed six so when you add here ninety five plus six
is one not one but your dice has board has just hundred so what will you do then you will stop
at hundred and you would say that you have won so that particular check has to be done here
so this is I am sorry for this this is the same players player ones points has to be changed I
am sorry for that and here as I had said you have to check in case during this addition process
have you gone beyond the end point so in that case you have to come back to the end point so
that check let us make if the points points of player one has exceeded end end point then
you are suppose to say you bring it to end point that is ninety five he was present six came
up so he is supposed to go to one not one since the board ended at hundred you stop at
hundred that is what we are stimulating here this is to the functionality here is to check if the
player goes beyond the board beyond the board this is being check here alright Now you are
suppose to print him his score as of now you say his name player one name your score your
score is this value pp one that is storing the points of player one alright if he has reached the
end points as I have said earlier this is an infinite loop you may wonder that when you have
reach the end point you have to quit the game but here we have given an infinite loop now to
break this loop we are performing a particular check if you have reached the end if you have
reached the end with this current points that is whether this particular current points is the end
point or not here checking if the person has reached the end I am sorry I have used the extra
bracket its seems sorry if it’s just a space if this if this particular player has reached the end
you are suppose to print the message player one name his name you are supposed to give and
won player one this person has won the game you are suppose to display it and once you had
displayed it you come out of the loop you break that this particular place we are using break
because the user wants to quit the game here we are breaking that is here we are quitting the
game because one person has reached the end point this is the check for player one this is a
player ones turn anything maybe possible right player one may reach the end point player two
may reach the end point so we will perform all this checks in player two as well alright let get
back to this if turn then else this all this whatever we had done are for player one let us the
same as to be repeated for player two so let us copy paste everything copy ok let me paste it
this is for player two player two you will modify everything to player two player two sorry
this is player one I am sorry for this because here the player wants to quit and we are suppose
to display both their points this is player one and player two and now here it is player two is
player so his points are added so layer two player two alright player two player two player
two player two player two player two layer two player two alright so we are given rough
overview of the game let us save this up to here I will give you the summary of what all just
happened till now we have inputted the name of two players we have initially set their points
to zero and we have some variable called turn which will actually keep track of who has to
play now and the turns zero two four six and so on are for player one one three five seven
and so on for player two to keep track of that we are using this particular operator modulo
denoted by percentage which will return the reminder after the divisions so we are dividing it
by two if the reminder turns out to be zero it is player ones turn otherwise it is player two turn
so one thing I guess I skipped here is I skipper here is I should have should have incremented
the turn yeah I should increment the turn right Once one player has done I should give the
chance to the next person so for that I
need to increment the turn that I have to do I have done that alright so what in each players
turn what are the checks that are being performed let me tell you that first we say that it is his
turn we are asking if he wants to continue or quit if he is quitting we specify the status till
now as to how many each person has scored and we are quitting the game in case he wants to
continue we are rolling the dice dice would give you a number from one to six some random
number that number is added to his points and then it is possible that that particular position
there may be a snake or a ladder we will be performing a check there if that is a snake or
ladder and appropriately the points would be changed and in case during the process of
rolling a dice the points exceeded the end point as I had given an example earlier if the
position was ninety five and the dice showed have six addition would give one not one where
as your board just as hundred so end point exceeded so in that case we should bring back to
end point so this check has been performed here and after that and after performing all the
check after performing the normalisation part we are displaying his score and we are
checking if that particular position is the end point or not if the person has reached the end
point is declared that this person has won and here we quit the game the quitting here is due
to the users choice quitting here is due to reaching of end point that is the difference here the
same thing is done for player two as well alright so the higher level overview of what play
does is given to you and check snake check ladder reached end these are the three
functionalities we have defined here that is we have we have just given the names here what
this particular functionality is suppose to do we will define later we will be defining in next
few minutes let’s see to it I hope you have understood what all happened till now you may
pause for sometime look back to what has happened you proceed once you got all the pieces
till now clear
Alright guys in the precious video we had seen how to display the board as well as higher
level overview of the game playing so in that we had used some functionalities like some
functionality we had used it like check snake check ladder we will define that now define
check snake or check ladder may we let us start with it check snake check ladder initial view
I had asked you guys to make a note of all these points where ladders were there the points
where it start the point where it ended I had asked you guys to make a note of it I hope you
would have made a note of it based on that we will be writing this code if the first ladder we
saw was at eight so we say check ladder this takes an argument points so some specific points
is given we are checking if there is some ladder at that point and if there is a ladder we will
return what will be the new points after crossing that ladder that will be returned if the points
is equals to eight this is where we have the first ladder then you are suppose to print that you
have to notify the user that he has actual stepped on to ladder you print that this is a ladder
then you return the new position the ladder at eight actually landed at twenty six so you
return twenty six now the next ladder is at twenty one twenty one the thing is the same so let
me copy paste it or I will type ladder this ladder lands you at eighty two so I will return
eighty two so the same pattern will continue for other ladders too so let me copy paste this
block after twenty one the next ladder is at forty three that is taking you to seventy seven the
next ladder is at fifty that is taking you to ninety one the next ladder is at fifty four that is
taking you to ninety three the next ladder is at sixty two it is taking you to ninety six the next
ladder is at sixty six it is taking you to eighty seven the next ladder is at eighty that is taking
you to hundred the end point here if you haven’t stepped into any of these points that is once
after a dice is rolled we check whether that is a ladder point are not these were the ladder
points if the points at which we are making a check by synch match any of these things that
means you have not stepped into a ladder so you get beck the points what was added you
don’t have any bonus so else this is not a ladder not a ladder so you return the same points
that is no addition of points no increment of points nothing is there no change in points just
return back what you got this is how check ladder functionality works Alright! In a similar
fashion we can write check snake functionality check snake the first snake you have is at
forty four let me check that if points aright this event takes an argument points at this
particular point whether there is snake or not if points is equal to the first snake is at forty
four if that is equal to forty four you have to print snake you have stepped into a snake you
need to note the player so you have to print the snake so snakes will bring down your points
so you will come down to twenty two so that you have to return it I will say points is the next
snake is at forty six right print snake print snake and then you return the value where it takes
you back it will take you to five so return five the snake at forty six is taking you down to
five so you are returning so this is the pattern for all the other points so let me copy paste this
ok the next snake is at forty eight that will take you to nine the next snake is at fifty two that
will take you to eleven the next snake is at fifty five it is taking you to seven the next is at
fifty nine that will take you to seventeen the next is at sixty four it will take you to thirty six
the next is at sixty nine that is taking you to thirty three the next is at seventy three it will take
you soon to one the next is at eighty three that is taking you to nineteen the next is at ninety
two that will take you to fifty one the next is at ninety five it will take you to twenty four the
next is at ninety eight it is taking you to twenty eight else these were the points where there
were snakes otherwise you have not stepped into a snake not a snake so there is no change in
points you just return back the same points this is how check for snake has been made this is
nothing this is very simple that I had shown you a board in the very first video when I have
asked you to pause the video and make a note of the snake and ladder where it starts where it
takes you to based on that I had written this code you check if it is those special points in that
case you display a message whether you have sadder at a snake or ladder and accordingly you
modify the points you return the modified points so now I guess you could get it in the play
functionality when we were using see we add the points and we check if that points is a
ladder if it is a ladder here you will get the modifies points if it is not a ladder you would get
back the same point here similarly the check snake functionality also works the difference is
ladder takes you from a lower point to a higher point if you step into a ladder snake will take
you from a higher point to a lower point if you step into a snake that is only difference if you
didn’t step into a snake or a ladder you would retain the same points alright so these two
functionalities are over so reached end this particular functionality is to be realised let us do
that now realise is nothing but now you del deep into a to check the code nothing but you
give the code that is what you call as realise reached end at this particular points you are
checking whether you have reached end nothing if the particular points is equal to end point
you say true else you say false that is the logic this is the plain thing there is an end point
defined you just check whether this given value is equal to that end point if that is the case
then you return true true else you return false this is how this works let me save and I am
getting an error is it input only I guess the same input will work input I guess it will work
yeah oh that is the raw input for other use I am sorry for this confusion this is input input
works alright so we are almost done with the code everything has been defined see the code
has been modularised well the first thing we have to do is we have to show the board then we
have to play he next step is we are playing the next step is we are playing first we show the
board then we play that is the what we are doing this so this is the highest level of overview
so now if you want to know what this particular show board functionality doing is we have an
image file we take it open it and show the image that is the that is what this particular
functionality show board is doing then the next functionality is the play functionality which is
our main functionality here what you do is you input the names of two players you initially
set their points to zero you have some variable call turn which denotes which player has to
play now then you ask him if he wants to say that this is this person turn if he wants to
continue or quit the same so based on that if he wants to quit you quit the game there by
denoting the status till now or if he wants to continue you roll a dice based on what what is
shown up in the dice you add his points and then check if he has landed in a snake or a ladder
if so you modify his points otherwise you do it you do not do anything you just retain his
points so that basically what you do is you add his points and then you check if he has landed
into a ladder or into a snake and sometimes it may happen that during the process of rolling a
dice you may go out of the board in that case you are supposed to stop at the end of the board
itself so this check is done here then you display his score and say if he has won when his
points is exactly the end points you just you have to check if he has reached the end point or
not if he has reached the end point you say that he has won this is the higher level overview
you have a variable turn denotes who has to play if he wants to quit display the status and
quit otherwise roll a dice add points check if has landed into a ladder or a snake and if he has
reached the end points you quit the game this is the higher level overview now the detail
functionalities checking ladder checking snake this I had defined based on the board I had
shown to you to check those specific points if that particular point has been reached you
display that he had stepped into a ladder or snake appropriately and then you return the points
where he will land finally you return that if he hasn’t stepped into it just return back the same
points so that there is no change in the points that’s how these things works and reached end
this functionality what it check is whether the points this person has got is same as the
defined end point or not this is the check performed here this occurs continuously and one of
the condition will lead to quitting if the game one is the player voluntarily wants to quit the
game the second condition is someone has reached the end point these are the two constrain
these are the two places where the game will quit alright this is how we have coded now you
please pause and see till now what has happened or you understand the functionalities you
understand the overview level as well as to the details in depth you proceed from this way
itself these are the major functionalities now let me tell deep into it this way you just
consider you have been given a big box you open that box then get a smaller box then you
open it then you get a smaller box this is how we are organised a code you understand this
well and this once you are very clear with it will proceed with the running of this program
alright please pause and understand this very well
Alright till now we have coded the snake and ladder game we have split into various
functionalities for easier understanding I hope you had revised it you had gone through all
the functionalities you are clear with what each functionalities is doing now let us run and
see this The board has been displayed and here you are supposed to enter your name so
maybe let me say abc is my first name my first player name is abc and second one let him be
xyz abc this is your turn you have to continue or you have to quit I want to continue the dice
showed six and see the initial points was zero abc score is six now because the dice showed
six and there was no snake and ladder at that point so the score remain six only now this is
xyz turn if you want to continue or quit I want to continue dice again showed six so
currently both are in the same status you want to continue yes the dice showed three so I am
at nine I want to continue yes both are at the same place yes I want to continue it’s getting
interesting I want to continue wow now here the player two has an upper hand this is going
interesting you can play on and on the whole day good luck You have got great pass time
now great guys now let me quit this but I am gonna play this tonight I won’t think that I will
sleep tonight this is so good I am so happy with this I am gonna play this I hope you guys too
enjoyed this thank you for watching have a nice day
Well luckily with animation fantasy is your friend said the great film makers Steven Spielberg
so let us open the world of animation with our next choice spiral traversing
We have been looking at pretty straight forward programming questions nothing has been
very challenging a questions so for I would now like to give you a question which actually
isn’t straight forward which requires a whole lot of thinking and of course programming time
So let me pose the question for you all do you see the animation here What’s happening
You just seeing the white dots spiralling around and going to the centre in a particular way
correct How easy for us to do this Well! Isn’t all it appears though it’s pretty straight
forward it is not that easy firstly how can you even do such an animation so let me go step by
step and explain to you all how we can actually fill the entire screen with white dotes in this
particular fashion forget what I showed you let us go step by step Do you now see this four
cross four entry of numbers there are numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen and I want the numbers to be displayed in the
following way firstly it should be one two three four and then you must climb down eight
twelve sixteen and then towards your left fifteen fourteen thirteen and then up nine five and
then right six seven down eleven left ten you should basically traverse this table with these
numbers these way alright What do I mean by that All I mean is you should display this
numbers in this particular fashion only let me try to be more clear with a nice example so
here is the exact question if the input is four you create a four cross four table like this in
your program don’t display it just create it and each cell corresponds to a row and column
isn’t it Look at this first cell it is first row first column I am gonna call it one comma one I
will create a list or maybe a tuple whatever is comfortable for you and then use that term one
comma one to denote this cell the second one first row second column this will be one
comma two likewise one comma three one comma four two comma one two comma two
two comma three and so on up to four comma four so the input is the dimension of the table
if the input was five you should come out with the five cross five table it was six six comma
six if its n in general it’s going to be n cross n so given four I create this four cross four tuples
one comma one one comma two so on and then I want to display them in the following order
only remember the spiral thing that I showed you I want it in that order only by that I mean
observe one one one two one three one four two four three four four four four three four
two four one three one two one two two two three three three and three two should be the
order in which you must display you see where I am getting that given a n cross n table you
must spiral n like this what is spiralling n you must simply display this addresses of the cells
as simple as that so input is a number some ten and you must create a ten cross ten table and
spiral n on that table and display it Remember we started off with this little graphics
animation every simple and straight forward one looks like the animation of animation that
was done some forty years back animation is so sophisticated right now this is far to be
regarded an animation but then as a practice exercise I wanted you to all understand doing
something as simple as this requires good amount of thinking I spoke to you about
displaying the entries of table right I am going to use that right now and I am going to show
you how we can create this graphics animation using just simple idea of taking n and
displaying n cross n cells in a particular way you now know enough to go ahead and write a
quick program which will do the animation let us see how this is done amit will now show
you how to use your knowledge of displaying the cells in the table and create this graphic
animation
Hello guys in this video is little bit different we are going to do some kind of animation here
and in order to do this animation will we don’t need any pre requisites we don’t need to know
any graphics or any other libraries but two things we need to understand how to store
represent matrix in python second how to print it in different orders so in this video the main
crux of the programme is to print the matrix in the spiral order so what do I mean by the
spiral order It means that you will start from the first element is represented let’s say zero
zero comma zero and then you will print the first row then you will go to the last column and
print the last column all the elements of the last column then last row in reverse order then
first column in reverse order and so on now why is this important How I am linking it with
the animation So after this program after we write this program after we do the traversing
of a matrix in spiral order and do the animation with it you will be able to make something
like this This is exactly the spiral order traversing of a matrix you can see as I am printing
the first row and last column then last row in reverse order first column reverse order and so
on it will go like this in until it it’s the center so in order to perform this animation I don’t
need to understand any any kind of graphics I just need to know how can I print a matrix in
spiral order and use that logic to do this in animation so after this video after we write the
program you will be able to know how can we create such kind of animation or such kind of
pattern easily so let’s see this in next video
Hello guys let’s see this matrix that we have on the screen it’s the four cross four matrix
with elements one two three four five sic seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen and sixteen so usually how we print usually in whatever lectures you saw till now in
most of them whenever we are using any matrix or printing it or traversing it we usually
traverse in row wise manner what do I mean by the row wise manner So see this matrix first
I go to the first element my first element is one which is present at zero comma zero so I will
go there I will print it then I will go to the next element next element is the first row and
second column which is here which is the which is two so let’s see this I will go to the second
element and I will print it Then I will go to the third element which is present at first row
third column which is three then next element is four first row last column now after printing
the first row I will shift to the second row first column which is first element of second row
which is five here then I will go to the six seven eight second row is over third row nine
Ten eleven twelve third row is over fourth row thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen see
usually we print like this in this program we are not going to do this then we are going to do
something else we are going to print the elements of this matrix only let’s say in a different
order which is spiral order so let’s let’s see what do I mean by spiral order Suppose I have
the same matrix I will start with one first element I will print all the elements of the first row
which is one two three four then I will not shift to the second row I will just print all the
elements of last column which is eight twelve sixteen then I will print all the elements all
the remaining elements of last row in reverse order which is fifteen fourteen thirteen then
the first column all the remaining elements in reverse order which is nine and five one is
already printed now what is left In the second row I will print all the elements in the simple
order which are left which are six seven I will go to the third row and I will print eleven and I
will print after that ten so in this this is a four cross four matrix then ten is the middle
element so this is how we are going to perform and you know if you can print something like
this then you just need to add a library which we are going to use a turtle library and with that
library rather than just printing the elements will print some kind of dot coloured dot and it
will look like we are animating something so this is what exactly we are going to do so let’s
do this Hello every one so in this video we are going to write the program for spiral traversal
of the matrix so in the first program I am going to make two programs In first program will
print the matrix in spiral order just what we saw in the last video so will see how we can do
this so let’s do this let me create a function name spiral def spiral and what are the
parameters of this function M is the number of rows then n is the number of columns and ‘a’
is the is my matrix so ‘a’ is actually a list of list through which I will representing the matrix
Let me define two variables one is ‘k’ equal to zero and l is equal to zero let me tell you what
these variables are ‘k’ is actually the starting index of the row which is zero l is the starting
index of the column which is also zero we know that m is the number of rows in the matrix
and n is the number of columns in the matrix so let me write this term you guys already
know that if you want to command multiple lines you have to do with this then you can
command multiple lines so let me write this ‘k’ is index of starting row l is the index of
starting column ok now what we have to do We have to first print the first row the first row
should be fully printed then we have to shift to the last column and print the all the elements
of the last columns so let me write a while loop while see ‘k’ ‘k’ is the index of the starting
row starting row index Why ‘k’ is less than l Means that ‘k’ is when I am going through all
the elements of row so I am exhausting all the rows if I am getting over all the rows then I
should not print anything because my rows are over so ‘k’ should be less than m and l should
be less than n what do I mean L is the starting column index so all the columns are
exhausted so when all my rows and end all my columns are exhausted I have to stop the loop
ok while k is less than m and l is less than ‘n’ first I have to do is since I am starting first I
have to do I have to print all the elements of first row so that let me write a loop for I in
range see elements of first row ok I have to exhaust all the elements through all the columns
so I have to go through first column index second column index keeping my row fixed I have
to go through the first column second column third column fourth column and so on so my
row index is fixed at a just traverse to the column so I will so my range will be l to ‘n’ to keep
this in mind that this ‘n’ is whenever we type range range starts from suppose you write in
the parameter you give in range is zero comma five so it will go like zero one two three four
not up to five ok so hence I am writing ‘n’ because n is my number of elements number of
columns ok so suppose if I give four it will go to an l is zero so it will zero one two three four
times but it will not go up to four as four so I can safely write here ‘n’ ok inside this loop I
will print my elements which are print ‘a’ see my row is fixed ok I will just write ‘k’ here
because the first ‘k’ index of first row and I so I have to print I have to traverse row all of the
columns so I is the column index so row is fixed row is zero and I will print all the elements
so the first row You all know that if I have to print the elements in one line with this space I
have to do like this and with apostrophe inverted comma sorry awesome after this when the
first row is over I have to go to the second row I have to see I have to go to the second row
when the first row is over one two three four I have to go to the second row so second row is
important so now here see second row second row but I have to print the elements of last
columns eight twelve sixteen so in this traversal the my column is fixed where I have to
traverse through all the remaining rows see remaining rows are second row third row and
fourth row but the column is fixed column is the last column so I will do this see this before
so that we don’t forget here let me command this commanding is the best practice ever you
guys should command every time whenever you write a code so that you revisit you can
understand what you wrote anyone who is trying to understand your program or trying to
reinvent your program or use your program can understand what you did so it’s better to
command so let me write here what we did We print the first row so printing the first row
from the reaming rows after this is over when my elements of first row are printed first ok I
have to go to the second row so I will do k plus is equal to one which means that now I am on
the second row those row index has been increase k is my row index started from zero but
now it is of first I mean second row ‘k’ is equal to one now I have to print the elements of last
column now here I have to traverse route the remaining rows ok and my column should be
fixed so let me write this for I in range my column is fixed you should remember so I have to
traverse through the rows so which is k to m which is because I have already incremented my
k so it will go to the remaining k the last row m is the last row index because m is the number
of rows I will just print here print ‘a’ I have to traverse through row so ‘i’ column is fixed
which is bought n minus one now why here n minus one because again I have to say this
because is the number of columns so suppose my number of columns are four since every
time list starts from zero so here it should be suppose number of columns are four number of
rows are also four I have to put two in order to be in the last column I have to put three here
because arrays list always starts from zero so three array I have to put for that I ma putting n
minus one here I put k only because k is already zero so I don’t have to take care of minus
one here but here I have to take care again I will write end is equal to grid and my last
column is over last column is over means I have to shift my columns to the second last what
do I mean by the second last Since now here n is pointing at let’s say if number of rows and
number of columns are four four n was pointing at four so n minus one was three now I have
to shift to the last column so second last column so that for that I have to do n minus equal to
one let me again command this line printing the last column form the remaining column
awesome! This is done now here is some tricky part let’s see this now we are on the last
second last column a last row second last column so we did this now we have to print this ok
see the tricky part here is we have to print it in the reverse order this is the reverse order
sixteen after that fifteen fourteen thirteen you have to go in the reverse order for that what
will you do if you have to check the number of rows are not exceeding the row index is not
exceeding the number of rows why I am doing it again here see I already checked it in the
while loop but it might happen that after this condition the k might become that’s a five we
should not open here we should not escape the five comes here and not stating this condition
that there is a bugging the program so for that I have to put the condition again inside this if it
is fine then I will write for I in range ok now what I have to do I have to start from the
second last column I already decremented my n by minus one so I am already on the second
last column since n is the number of columns I will start from n minus one where I have to go
I have to go to the first column first column is index at zero now it might happen that since
we are doing a generalised program it might occur it might not go to the zero it may for
example in this part when I am printing eleven and ten I have to go to ten only I don’t have to
go to nine after that ten eleven after that ten ok so I have to go I have to go to the last starting
column index starting column index for now it is zero ok for now it is zero but it may not be
zero after some time so for that I will write n minus one because again the range range
doesn’t go to the doesn’t include this value it doesn’t include this value but I need this value
for that I need l minus one so that I can go to l is at l since I am going in the reverse direction
I am decrementing n minus one n minus two n minus three n minus four up to l I have to go
I have to write here that’s minus one minus one is my step so by default step is always one
positive one so you always go one two three four five suppose you want to go five to one
five four three two one you have to write here you will start form five and up to zero if you
want to go up to one n minus one so let me five four three two one this is my step function ok
so I will go up to l minus one and inside I will just print my array ‘a’ n minus one row row
minus one and will start last row because I am in the last row an n minus one because m is
the number of rows hence you play that’s it Great! I am done with the last row ok so I will
decrement my rows ok because now I am on the last row I want to go to the second last row
so I am here I was here printed all the elements of this row I have to go to the second last row
I have to decrement my row index not row index I mean number of rows which is m minus
one this is done now next is again let me command this line so that I don’t it printing the last
row from remaining rows ok now what is left I am on the second last row I have to print the
elements in the second last row I have to print ok second last row I have to print the elements
of the first column in reverse order again ok we have to do this in the reverse order again so
for that again I have to check if l is less than n ok if l is less than n then inside this I will write
loop for I in range m minus one because is already decremented here and I want to start from
the second last row second last row to where the first row I have to go until first row so k
minus one ok because I have to go until ‘k’ whatever k is so for now k is one thing of the
second row because we printed the elements of first row here and we incremented our k to
the second row I want to go to the up till second row so that’s why I am writing k minus one
here ok and again step function is minus one because I have to decrement ok and here I will
write print ‘a’ I of l that’s it awesome this is done I will just increment my l here because
again let me tell you l is the l was the starting column index so after I printed this first column
all the elements of first column I have to go to the second column once I printed this I have to
go to the second column and again do the same thing which I did here I have to do the this
thing again here and next thing here and next thing here next thing here nothing is there sorry
so this loop will take care of it ok that’s why you wrote this loop let me command this again
printing the first column from the remaining column awesome! This is done our program is
ready printed everything now let me create my array so let’s array is ‘a’ ok for I in range how
many rows I want I want four rows for j in range ok for columns let me create a index list
here l it’s an for now let me I write the elements like one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten up to sixteen so I will take the count variable and put it one and here I will just
append the count variable and increment it ok so I have the elements so j will take care of a
rows and the elements of four first row let’s say after the first loop of the after the first loop j
is over and I append that the list l whatever I got after this loop in the in the in my array ‘a’ in
my matrix ‘a’ so ‘a’ dot append l that’s it my ‘a’ is over I have my ‘a’ and I will call the
functions spiral number of let’s say rows are four number of columns are four ‘a’ now let’s
see this ok let’s see sorry cool I got my spiral traversal one two three four then eight twelve
sixteen fifteen fourteen thirteen nine five six seven eleven ten it is Yeah One two three four
eight twelve sixteen fourteen thirteen nine five six seven eleven ten cool so this is over you
can check this you can write in a different way this is one of the way of writing this program
the spiral traversal you can write in a different way also you can create your own logic there
is another way which is known as recursion but not we are we will not cover this because it
might get little bit complicated but it is cool you may check depths how we can write a
recursive program to print the elements in spiral order so see this and we are going to use this
logic spiral traversal in our main program which is creating the pattern
Hello every one now in last video we saw we can traverse some matrix in spiral order now in
this video we will see how we can create such animation what we saw in the first video for
that we are we are going to use a library named as turtle if you have installed anaconda the
turtle comes with the anaconda you can check if it is not there you can simply install with
pip just search try searching how to install the turtle with pip and everything is over just a one
line one command you can do it just install turtle and you can read more about turtle from
here the documentation provided by the turtle library you can see a lot of functions at their lot
of functionality they have given let of examples are there you can use the examples to
understand how you can create animation through turtle actually it is used to create patterns
and that’s what exactly what we are doing what we show what we showed during the first
video so let’s see this so in order to start with will first create a simple turtle program to show
you how it works so let’s see this First have to import the turtle library so that import turtle
that’s it ok after that I have to create a turtle a turtle is a kind of pen which works on the
canvas so for that I will create a variable tur lets say and I will create my canvas turtle dot
turtle so my turtle has been created now I want to create a simple square box so for that I will
write a loop for I in range five I will forward this pen tur turn which I am saying is the pen on
my canvas at some pre define starting position so I will just forward it tur dot forward
function is there with with fifty units ok and then after it got provided with fifty units I will
turn this pen position within angle of ninety degree so for that I have to use the function dot
write it always take the parameter as an angle so I have to take give ninety which means it
will turn it with ninety degree and do all this thing again ok that’s it I am done with this I
have to write turtle dot done great let me run this Cool I got my square see its working
perfectly ok let’s do something else let me create a loop of let’s just say fifteen stances and I
will change the angle with let’s say one forty four degree let’s see what happens Something
is wrong let me run this again ok see this see I created a star so you can using this you can
create a lot of beautiful patterns with different colours ok great so we are going to use this
library to create our pattern which is spiral traversing and animation depth we saw in the first
video we are going to create exactly the same animation with this turtle library Thank you
Hello everyone in last video we saw how we can use basic turtle I mean we can use the turtle
library to create basic programs basic pattern programs and basic animations will use this in
our will use the turtle in our last program that we did for the spiral traversing to create the
pattern that is creating the animation where there were dots printed in spiral order so this is
the program which which I created which I created before traversing the matrix in spiral
order will use this programme to create the animation so let me first import the turtle import
turtle by default whenever a turtle is created the canvas which is created has a default white
value the background colour is white I am going to need a background colour of black so I
will create a canvas of black background for that turtle dot bg colour that is black ok now I
will create a turtle name Seurat to create I have to write turtle dot turtle I created a turtle
whenever I am going to traverse towards the matrix I am going to print a dot for that I need a
circle kind of thing so for that I need a width variable I will create a width variable of size let
say five and a height variable of size seven and whenever I go to a particular element I will
print this thought and I will move forward with some distance so I need that distance so I will
write the distance at dot underscore distance which is let’s say twenty five ok create now I
created this turtle but I need a initial position for where it should start for that I will set the
initial position is dot set position to minus two fifty comma two fifty you can change the
position according to your program but I am keeping it minus two fifty comma two fifty it
actually starts centre all with always starts from centre so if you put zero comma zero it the
position of the turtle will be at the centre of the canvas but I need it at the left most top most
left corner so for that I am keeping it the x coordinate as minus two fifty and y coordinate as
two fifty while I see this I need the colour of the dot as white because my background is
black so for that I will write dot colour which is white great now inside my while loop I will
go ok whenever I print first row after printing the first row my after going through the first
row my turtle position should be at angle of ninety degrees should move at the angle of
ninety degrees so that it can go downwards so in order to go downwards I have to put it
downwards I have to put the position of turtle I have to move the position of the turtle within
the angle of ninety degree but it should be it should print as the first row as as usual I mean it
should go forward in the right direction it should not print in downward direction from the
first row only so from that I will create a variable to check that lets say flag of f as zero ok
after printing this ok so I will check here if f is equal equal to one it means I already printed
the first row I will move the position of I mean that direction of a turtle at the angle of ninety
degree to the right ok and here after printing the first row now I don’t need to print the array
here just command it and instead of this I will write here ok dot forward with distance which
I put as the variable dot distance ok and after I print the first row I need to set my flag value
which means if this is ok and after this you always have to turn the position of the turtle at the
angle of ninety degree to the right side that’s why I created this flag value of the left ok done
so first row is over after the first row ok I print the elements of the row I have to print the
column I mean in the first iteration I was printing the last all the elements of last column so I
have to print in the downwards way for that I have to change the angle of my turtle to
downwards it means to the right of ninety degree that is dot right I put ninety degree again
here I don’t need to print the elements I will just command it and I will write my turtle I will
forward my turtle to dot distance after this again I have to change the direction of my turtle
to the ninety degree for that dot right ninety that’s it this is also printing I don’t need this so I
will just command it and instead of printing the element I will just forward my turtle forward
with dot distance again same thing after printing the last row I mean the row in reverse order
I have to again change the direction so I will do this right ninety here again I will not print
this I will forward let me copy this and forward it distance ok great so now I don’t need all of
these arrays because I am not printing any of the array nor I need this count value ok I just
have to call this let me change the parameters here this is ok let me do this for the value
twenty rows and twenty columns ok I am done so I will write turtle dot done lets run this
cool See I created my spiral traversing so I am getting lines ok this is all what we have to do
now little after little tuning up we get created what we get created in the first video what we
saw in the first video so this is exactly what you wanted to do you can you can take this
program change whatever order you want to change this is the main program actually you
can fill the colours you can change the shape you can you can do something else ok but this
is the main program ok thank you
So in this program what I was doing I was doing two things first I created a list of colours let
me zoom it ok so first I created a list of colours a list colour white yellow brown red blue
green orange pink Violet grey cyan you can give lot of colours you can check the top line
second what I was doing rather than printing the line if you just forward the the position of
the turtle it will just print a line you can create a dot also so there is a function in order to
create a dot which is known as turtle name dot dot and it will create the dot with with the
way you want to create it ok so it will create a small dot the colour we the colour we want to
create so in this I am at random on the random basis I am writing different colours ok so
that’s that I am doing here and for that first you have to remove your lining pen not to remove
lining pen you have to write a call off function which is known as penup which will penup
means that it will not it will not create a simple line rather than when I will call the function
dot function it will create a dot and go forward at the time of forwarding it will not print
anything so penup will not after putting penup it will not print anything whenever you print
when will you call a dot function it will print a dot there and move forward that’s it that’s
what I was doing exactly there so and every time what I was doing I was calling a random
function so you can see here call randint from zero to ten zero to ten means within these
these our spoiling colour from this list and using that colour every time so that the colour
changes randomly this is the pronoun for the pattern it is the same pronoun which we which
we which we wrote in the last video only little bit tunes up so you can create your own
program you can change this so I will recommend you guys to please change the program and
create your own pattern using this parallel order only you can different things also you can
one more thing you can do is you can rather than going from the first element which is
present at zero comma zero and going to the middle element you can start from the middle
element and you go you can go in the reverse parallel order to the first element So this
program hopes like this so yeah it will show a spiral order like this with dot you can even
create some other shapes rather than dot you can see the turtle documentation you can create
different shapes actually you can create your own shape also and I am not doing anything I
am just randomly changing the colours by picking up the random colour form the list of
random colours which are defined as a variable and I just put it on the same program which I
wrote in the last video so that’s it so why to do this Because it’s just fun that’s it nothing else
so please post your questions and whatever problems you are facing in this regarding this
video in the discussion form we would like to help you guys to do this program to learn
interactive programming with python and please if you please I would like you guys to
change this program to make something else if you have some new ideas please please post
it on discussion form Thank you Hey guys suppose I asked you to go to a remote place in
your city so what would be the first thing that will come to your mind Off course that would
be gps so our next choice is about gps
Hello friends welcome to yet another joy in our course or you must be aware of gps the
global positioning system it is something it will let you share your location on whatsapp or
track your route using goggle maps Gps is actually a network of satellites that help tracking
the geographical locations of an individual keeping the technical stuff aside let me give you a
nice motivation about this joy Assuming this story some time back one of my friends owning
a pizza delivery company calls me he has complaints of late deliveries from is customers and
he installs a gps tracker on the delivery bikes hoping that this would solve his problems but
instead of giving the location name gps tracker gives raw information in the form of latitude
and longitude information in order to help my friend I need to write a code that helps him
track the route of his delivery boys but can we do it using python Of course yes but how can
we do it Well we have amit to our rescue let’s find out
HI guys in this video we will see given a set of routes how we can plot the route on Google
maps so for this we are going to use two languages these are gm plot and csv library what
you have to do exactly what’s the problem Let me explain So you are given a set of plots ok
and is you have to plot these routes on Google map so how you can do this So suppose this is
my file named as route dot csv and these are the coordinates coordinates means the first
number which is shown near latitude second number is shown in the longitude so it is
separated by a comma so that’s why this file name is route dot csv csv means dot csv file
format is comma separated by this so whatever the values are there separated by comma you
can open these file in spread sheet also or in any simple text editor so we will recommend
you guys to use blind text or you can use any simple text editor so suppose I have list of
coordinated here so in the video you saw that there is a guy and he was wondering around on
bicycle and the manager what he did he put a gps system in his bike so that he can he can see
the routes where he is going and whether he is delivering in the correct location or not or he
is wondering off any where so suppose he get the information in this file dot csv file and
these are the locations where he were where the person went know how to plot this because
these number doesn’t make me sense I don’t know what to do with this I don’t know where
he went exactly so there is a way we can plot this so in this video we will see how we can
plot this on Google maps and how we can see what the routes are been followed by this
values so let’s tuned on and let’s see in next video
Before we start plotting the routes let me go through this route dot csv file one more time and
will see how we can pass this file using our csv library that I said in the last video you know
this route dot csv file has well need the coordinates in separated by commas it mean that first
value is the latitude value and the second value separated by comma is the longitude value
The first step is to pass this data how to how to extract this information from this file in
python So let’s see this So I will create a new new python file name gps dot py and I will
import this csv library you can read more about csv library on goggle there is a nice
documentation here you can read all the functions and the data provided by the library please
have a look at it and I will be using very simple passing method to pass the csv file so let’s
see this I will import the library first import csv ok now my csv file name which I want to
pass the name of the file is route dot csv so I will open that file with open route in commas
route dot csv in green board because I don’t have to write anything as f would say you can
put here an variable name here ok after opening it I will use a radio function so I will create a
variable name reader and I will use the csv reader function to pass this f what what! What it
does it will create a iterator through this file ok so that I can iterate over it and I can read the
values one by one as the list so so now my reader variables has on the on the data of the csv
file I have been iterative so I can iterate over it so what will you do I will iterate over it using
the loop for let’s say row in reader ok now row will give me row will contain list so each item
of this list will be a value separated by comma so first will be the first value and second will
be the second value after the comma third will be the third value after the comma like this in
string so let me print this so what I will do I will store the first value in lat that is equal to
row of zero ok because zeroth element of this list contain the first value and long is equal to
row of one because the first elements contains the second value that is the longitude I just
print it print lat print long or I will just create a dummy print so that I get a new line character
that’s it let me run this cool! so you can see all the latitude longitude values has been
extracted and printed ok so suppose what I do I will try to sum up let me print the some of
the latitude longitude just in some so what I will do here in the last print statement I will print
lat plus long ok it should print me the sum of this values so let me run this cool so you can
see the sum of latitude longitude ok so here is the problem it’s not exactly the sum what you
are getting is a concatenation of two strings so as I said this these are not the float values
these are string values so what are you getting is the concatenation of the string values
because the plus what in python if you do a plus in two strings it will concatenate the strings
you are getting a concatenated value so in order to get the sum of this latitude longitude you
have to change it you have to type cast that is we say type casting in c so it means you just
change the string value into float value so for that you just need a function float and inside
this so what it will do it will just change the string value into float now let’s run this now if I
run this now you can see I am getting this sum one not six point three four zero seven so now
I know how to pass it a simple passing a head of this csv file this is all required for this for
program In next video you will see how how to plot this latitude and longitude value So
now we know how to pass the csv file or using our csv library plot this on Google map for
this we need a different library name as gm plot so let me just import this gm plot here to see
that whether it is present on this anaconda cloud or not so I will put from gm plot import gm
plot let’s see you can see that it’s written that error module not found error no module named
gmplot means that this module is not present in the anaconda cloud it might happen that you
looking for some new module which is not on anaconda most of the time all the modules and
libraries are present in the anaconda that’s why we recommended anaconda but there some
library some new libraries which are still pending and which are not present on anaconda
cloud but you can download it One thing is that you can list all the libraries which are
present on the anaconda to do that you can just type on your terminal conda list will list all
the libraries which are downloaded by the conda which are present on the conda cloud so you
can see all these libraries which are present in your conda cloud ok you can see that gmplot
is not there so I am going to download it in order to download anything from conda you can
search each search it through conda the command is conda search gmplot now it will search
this gmplot named conda cloud in its cloud whether it is present in any of its channel if it is
present then it will download it might happen that may the library which we are looking for
may not be present you can see that package not found error thrown from conda this library is
not present in any of these channels in that case you have you can download the package
through pip so I will download pip install gmplot now pip will install this gmplot and it will
it will be automatically taken by the anaconda Ok it says that successfully installed gmplot
one point two point 0 so I will see this let me try this command again you can see that it has
been imported so it means that I can use this library now ok great let me delete this ok so I
will import my csv library import csv next I will import this gmplot from gmplot import
gmplot ok before I go any further you can read more about gmplot on you can Google it you
can read more about gmplot on get there is a get on library on gmplot on the radio material is
diploitation is provided how to place the map How to create polygon How to create the
marker and how to draw it how to see it all these things are present depend in this look Ok
so let’s see this So I will import the csv file csv library and gmplot library next what I will
do I will place mine map on a particular location for that there is a function so let me create a
variable gmap is equal to you can see here also that how to place your map to particular
coordinate to a location if you want to place the map to a particular location you need to write
the latitude longitude value of that location and you can use the Google map plotter
functional gmplot see you have to put the latitude longitude and the zoom resolution here the
exactly same thing I am going to do here gmplot dot Google map plotter ok and you can see
when I show the argument centre latitude center longitude and zoom here I will put my
location as twenty eight dot six eight nine one six nine this is one random location I put or
you can change it accordingly whatever you want to put there three two triple four eight and
let the zoom resolution will be seventeen so I will the gamp contains the map location where
I want to plot the second thing is I want to create the icon the icon which I am going to use
to plot my routes so I can just you just copy this line here ok you do not have to carry much
you can create your own icon here but I am going to use this Google icon you can just copy
this line and you will get the icon ok I have the icon I have the map now I will read the I will
pass my csv file so that I can plot I know how to pass it with open I will open my route dot
csv file dot csv ok as f I will create my reader iterator using the csv dot reader function I will
pass my file Let me create a variable name k using this k how will I use this So let me pass
this reader iterator iterate through it for row in reader ok so row will give me list of all the
values which are present in this csv file so I need to there are two values latitude and
longitude ok and store it in latitude and longitude so lat is equal to row zero since this is a
string value I need to have the float value I will convert it into float same thing which we did
in the last video the same I will store the longitude value is float of row awesome! Have the
latitude and longitude values float values now I am going to use the ‘k’ as a dummy variable
how if k is equal is equal to zero it means the first time this is the first coordinator I left then
what I will do gmap dot I will use the marker marker function I put the marker function put
the marker to a particular latitude to particular coordinate that latitude longitude put the
marker at this lat and long value which this is the first lat and long value with colour so let
me put the colours yellow ok and I will make a ‘k’ is equal to one which means that this was
the first and after this whatever is coming you can do something else if you want so else if it
is not the first coordinate which means the ‘k’ is also ‘k’ value is not zero means first value is
already ‘k’ and you already put yellow mark at there so whatever is coming after the first is
you can you create the I am creating the marker as particular latitude and long with colour
blue ok this is done since the last latitude longitude value the lat and long at the last after this
iteration will contain the last latitude longitude value again I would like to place a read
marker there what I will do put a gmap dot marker lat long of colour red that’s it at the last
location I will put red colour marker so we are done I just have to draw this map gmap dot
draw with html file that’s in my may dot html do it I am going to run this ok so I created a
my map dot html so let me see go to my folder it say let me open this with my chrome and
you can see so this is since it is yellow it is starting from which means this is the first location
ok this is the first location only that delivery guy started and then went till this particular
streets when some where some where these are the blue coordinates given by the gps device
and he going somewhere and you can see these are the locations he went these are the blue
locations there there these are the red location this is the last location So this is how you can
easily plot the coordinate if you have the coordinated you can plot it on Google map using the
python it’s very easy though I didn’t use any hard core programming there many libraries
through which you can do simple things that’s why python is so popular you can do a lot of
things with few lines of code because there are lots of library and the community is very
strong So thank you Hello guys welcome to programming screen cast in this programming
screen cast we would be seeing about a data structure that python offers you please don’t get
terrified by the term data structure it is nothing it’s just way which you can arrange your data
That is what you call as data structure in simple terms so python offers a lot of data structures
we had seen some of them in the previous weeks we had seen list you have been extensively
using lists and you will be also using in future and dictionaries we had seen you had
dictionaries in rock paper scissors game I guess so will see yet another data structure call the
tuples So the data structure name is tuple maybe I guess now you can see it the font size I
have increased the data structure name is tuple we call it as a tuple so what is basically a
tuple will see right So initially we will start with creating a tuple how can we create a tuple
So let me say I want to store the ice cream flavours which I like let us say ice cream flavours
let me say ice cream flavours equal to it’s a name of my tuple that’s a variable name so I will
say to create a tuple what you need to use is the normal paralysis the normal brackets open
and close bracket so within this you need to give the items of the tuple one maybe I can say
vanilla then I can say chocolate then butterscotch then strawberry maybe I will say strawberry
and so on you can give any number of flavours so alright so let me press enter alright my
tuple got created now if I say ice cream flavours see I got this tuple vanilla chocolate
butterscotch strawberry whatever I had added so you can use this way or you can print as
how had been using print ice cream flavours I think I was just pressing the tab key because of
which it got auto fill and please note that I am using the console I am explain using the
console if you feel that the screen doesn’t appear familiar just that I have maximised the
console that’s it I will press enter see I got it as a tuple ok so what if I want to print it one by
one how can I do that Simple just like how you use loops in lists or dictionaries something
like that say something like that you can use loop ok let us see how we can print the elements
one by one simple just like how you have some you have used loops in lists or dictionaries
previous data structure whatever data structures you had seen you can use a loop to print each
element individually as you wish so let me use a for loop for I will say flavours flavour in ice
cream flavours that is my variable name start my loop I will say print sorry its print I have to
say flavour so I have used an intuitive name you can use any variable name here for I j
anything you can use even though this is tuple of ice cream flavours I am using a variable
name flavour we got it one by one vanilla chocolate butterscotch strawberry alright so we
had printed the elements in the tuple and now in case if you want to access the individual
elements how would you do That is I just want to print chocolate let us say how would you
do Let us see chocolate is the second element in my list just like in my tuple so let just like
how I did in my list I will use the index indexing mechanism so let me say print what is this
tuple name ice cream flavours of the index I have to give its my second thing so let me give
two letters see what happens butterscotch see the third one gets printed so if I say two the
third one in the list got printed so what does that mean So the indexing mechanism the
python uses is different so that is it starts counting differently its starts counting from zero
just as how it did in list you should start counting from zero this is index zero vanilla is at
index zero chocolate is at index one butterscotch is at index two strawberry is at index three
this is how it counts we start counting from one and but the computer starts counting from
zero so if he want the second item we should give index one then we can get the second item
as per our view as per our perceptivity second item but for computer first item that is because
its start counting form zero so let us print it print ice cream flavours of one so that is the
second item actually if I print see I got chocolate which is the second one actually in the list
alright so this is how you access an item simple nothing but you give the name of the tuple
ice cream flavours you use this square brackets and give the index at which you are decided
item is present say let me say three strawberry got printed let me say I will let it be a typo I
will say thirty see tuple index out of range it throws an error in case such an item that is index
number thirty I have instead of printing three let in case I printed I typed as thirty that a typo
error given that there is no index thirty in the list it says index out of range that is there is a
range of the index value for this tuple that is zero one two three these are the allowed values
this thirty is out of this range is what the error means so it throws an error right so let us see
we have let us just summarise very quickly We had created a tuple ice cream flavours and we
had access the individual element to create a tuple what you did You just used the open
parenthesis and you just inserted the item and you had just access the elements so in case I
want to change something for example I don’t want to have butterscotch instead I would like
to add black current flavour so I want to modify the element or I want to add something
newly so how would I do that Let me see let me say tuple name is ice cream flavours just as
how you did in lists the update functionality let us try the same way because we are accessing
the elements in a similar way as that of the list using indexes so let us try updating as well the
same fashion as that in list so let us see ice cream flavours of it was in index two right
butterscotch so let me remove that and I want to make it as black current black current clack
current I made it as I don’t need an underscore here is a string so basically ok black current so
let me press enter see its throwing an error tuple object does not support item assignment its
telling something ok let me try adding it as new item so it was having zero one two three
right I want to add it at index four I will say index four is black current here I am trying to
add it initially I tried modifying it was not allowing me for what so ever reasons let me try
adding it the same error is being thrown again probably I have to delete that initial value and
again reassign the value probably that is how tuples work let me experiment let me say delete
the same key word that we used in dictionaries delete del ice cream flavours of two let me say
tuple object doesn’t support item deletion oh even this doesn’t work so let me ask for help
delete question mark that will give me a hint delete not found what happened Omg! Delete
ice cream flavours let me check let me ask for help tuple empty the tuple if I ask for a
question it says it will empty the tuple it says I cannot delete an individual item I cannot
modify an item I cannot add an item I cannot delete and individual item all that I can do is I
can delete the tuple completely I can delete the entire tuple so basically tuples are sort of data
structures which is fixed once of you fix something it remains as that as like that forever that
is what they technically call as immutable so those who have some knowledge of biology you
would have heard term called mutation that is nothing but some changes in your genes that is
what they call as mutation so the same terminology they have been using here as well we call
tuples are immutable because you cannot make changes as like you had made in list or
dictionaries if you use a tuples so tuples once if you fix something it is fixed forever now if I
say delete ice cream flavours the entire tuple would get deleted so let me check if I now call
ice cream flavours and I call it says name ‘ice cream flavours’ is not defined so what are the
options that is supported is you can create a tuple you can access the elements of a tuple and
you can delete it as a whole you cannot add anything modify anything delete a single item
nothing of sort can be done so it is sort of a foxed data structure alright it seems very
restrictive right so is there any other option Is there any other thing that can be done in tuple
so let me create a toy tuple for example create a toy tuple let me just use some numbers one
two three four given that I have deleted that ice cream flavours tuple so I am just creating
another tuple for demonstrating what else can be done so just like the length functionality of
the list can be used I will demonstrate length of toy will say four so the length functionality
can be used in case I want to see the count I can use the count functionality as well as if you
want to retrieve the specific index where the element position is where the particular element
is present you can see that toy dot count I want to count the number of times then number two
occurs it occurs one time so it says two the toy of count is one let me change the tuple once
for you let me making it as one two three four five one two three four one two three
four five so I had made a new tuple basically see initially I had toy is equal to one two three
four and here I have this you can ask me you said tuples are immutable you cannot change
them but how can you change this so what happens is that thing what I had created already
this gets destroyed and something new gets created that’s what happens so you if you
changing or if you try modifying in this way the old one get destroyed so whatever you once
seek that would remain fixed you cannot change it alright so let me show that for you length
of toy initially it was four now if I say it’s says nine so the earlier copy was completely
destroyed so now I can show you the functionality count toy dot count let me say how many
number of times the number two occurs it occurs two times number four occurs two times
number five once so count is the function that is how many number of times this particular
item is occurring in the tuple so in a tuple you can give numbers initially in ice cream favour
example we gave strings you can give it anything even the floating point value you can give
anything we will see some applications where the different types of values are given in tuples
so count is one functionality and other functionality you can have is index so let me say toy
dot index of five let me say five is present at index eight and if you say say for example two
it is present at index one it says but see two was present at two places so the index
functionality returns the very first index from the left where the particular item is present that
is what the index functionality does so these are some functionality that you can list length
count index that can be used in tuples also but something you can do in list which cannot do
in tuple is you are modifying an element adding a new element or deleting the particular
element those things are not allowed so tuples are sort of once you defined its fixed so such a
restricted data structure where can it be used I had post the question and probably you would
have thought the same I guess so why do they even create this Is it even useful Of course
yes it is used in many cases once such example I wills say say for example you are dealing
with rainbow rainbow is a tuple you can say the colours in rainbow violet vibgyor right!
Indigo blue green yellow orange red so once you have defined this as the rainbow no one
can further add or delete or undo anything about this so this is we want to the rainbow consist
of these seven colours its fixed so that you don’t want anyone to make any changes in such
scenario you can make use of tuples in one scenario where this would be useful this rainbow
even is a toy example you can consider as I just showed you to illustrate something that it is
fixed in the nature you cannot change no now can change this for such scenario you can use
tuples for one thing where in computer science they use tuples is in you can say in image
processing so in images the each individual unit of an image is called as a pixel this is
basically like human body contains cells cell is the basic unit of the human body something
like that the basic unit of the image is called a pixel so each pixel if you would as you would
have studied in your school physics each colour can be represented in terms of the three basic
colours namely red green and blue every colour any colour can be represented in terms of this
that is by proportions of red green and blue by taking ten percent red forty percent blue and
the rest green something like that by some proportions of red green and blue you can denote
any colour so every pixel will have a colour in an image so in case if that is a image of a grass
or some natural grass the top portion will be the sky it will have the blue value which will
have dominant and the bottom portion will be the grass which will have the green value
dominant in case you have sand there will be yellow it will be represented in terms of some
proportions of red green and blue as you can see every pixel has variation in colours each
colour can be represented in proportions of red green and blue so basically a pixel probably
would be defined like this pixel one there maybe millions of pixels in an image depends on
your camera resolutions where you would have seen that five mp camera eight mp camera
thirteen mp camera you heard these days right there may be different pixels it depends on the
camera resolution as there are number of pixels increases the clarity of the image also
increases so the pixel one contains some colour say yellow colour so it may be something like
point seven sorry its zero point seven comma zero point one comma zero point two
something like that some proportions of red green and blue rgb is the order in which they will
represent the pixels so in that case they internally represent each pixels in terms of tuples so
you don’t want to change this that is this should be the proportion in this image you don’t
want to change it that time they will say this is the particular pixel configuration that is this is
the colour that is associated with this pixel so in such applications in computer science tuples
come very handy alright you can think of many such applications where once you fix
something you don’t want to change it in such a scenario if you encounter some such scenario
you can consider using this data structures tuples alright guys thanks for watching the
programming screen cast have a nice day Have you ever tried your luck in gambling Well
you shouldn’t let us find out in our next joy named lottery simulation
What’s the matter You look worried yeah I have to share something with you Ok I have this
brother of mine who gambles a whole lot and I have tried convincing him several times not to
do I mean not to continue in that path but he never listens to me and he feels he is earning the
whole lot of them but I force him that he lose everything one day that is really bothering me
So what kind of gambling is that Ok let me explain and that is a system of ten units and he
bets on one unit if he wins then he will get the all nine units but if he loses then its its little
less but that is you invest hundred rupees yes and if you win you get nine hundred if you lose
you lose the hundred rupees yeah precisely actually deceptive yeah you feel as though you
can make a lot of money yeah that’s why he is feeling he is not loosing but I force that he is
you tried counselling him Yeah I tried several times I have told them but he never gives an
ear to it ok So what else can be done That’s what I am thinking I tried to see I am trying to
seek your help for it can is it possible that we can simulate this through a computer Ok so
you want to see whether whether you can simulate the process of wining or loosing yeah in a
game of gambling yeah and you want to see whether one can become rich or one undergo
very losses yes precisely I you see he is educated so if you help me with this I can assure to
him that see you are not in the right path and this is what actually happening I think this is
possible but this is popularly called the gamblers rule in problem probability but that aside
you want to see if we can simulate the enter process of gambling and try to figure out if
someone can even win or not of course we will win a few times we will lose a lot of times
let’s say we play here for one year’s time three sixty five days we would like to see whether
we make a lot of money or not right yes very good so what I will do I will try to help you
out with the simulation I will even give you the plots ok on what happens if you keep
playing for the next few days months years ok and the inference is starling enough to make
your educated brother stop gambling yeah let’s try our best though I cannot guarantee that he
will stop gambling because gambling is a disease its very tough to people to come out of it
but with proper counselling and making people understand the math behind it they might get
convince that they will go back upraise oh! If you do that with the computer I will be really
grateful should be possible let’s try I cannot guarantee you but I can tell you that once can be
hopeful because with proper counselling you can ensure that you can make any educated
person understand gambling don’t work Hello guys welcome to programming screen cast of
lottery stimulation so let me first introduce that is lottery simulation let me just give you a
brief overview I hope you have seen previous video where the procedure of lottery
simulation lottery was explained I will just give a brief overview so basically there are some
sort of coupons was available and you have to bet on one particular coupon and there draw
coupon randomly from the available list of coupon and if your betted coupon and the coupon
that appears matches you will win for playing this game you are supposed to place some
amount and if you win you get something much more than what you have paid so this is how
they try to tempt you to play the lottery so let me explain it let me take a very quick scenario
and explain it so let me assume that there are some ten coupons so basically each coupon
contain a digit a number from one to ten so one two three like that up to ten one number is
present in each coupon like that there are coupons that coupon contains the digits from one to
ten you are supposed to bet something say I say the number seven will appear if you draw
now I will say that so now after listening to my bet seven they will draw coupon randomly if
that randomly drawn coupon contains the number seven I win otherwise I lose to play this
game I have to pay say some hundred rupees if I win that if I get lucky and I got the same
number if I win I will get say thousand rupees ten folds see I am getting back ten folds or
even if you say nine hundred rupees anything I am getting much more than what I am paying
so I am really tempted to play this game so let us see what happens if I play this game if I get
lucky I will get much more than what I paid if I get unlucky I will lose hundred rupees which
is not very big deal let us try what happens let us try simulating it so to simulate this we will
use something called random so because you are randomly picking one coupon out of the
available coupons right so we are I am going to use package called random so let us say I will
say import random I hope you are you have used this package sometime so basically to deal
with something that happens with some probabilistic thing randomness we use this package
random so I will I will so say I have a bet so bet is something I have a number so let me say I
have to get the input of the bet the bet is the number I have to get a input input as you know
would generally take everything in terms of strings so I have to type cast it I have to change it
into integer type so let me do that int of input so I have to ask for what is your bet So I will
say your bet ok so I got the bet from the user once I have got the bet now I have to stimulate
the lucky draw let me say lucky draw so what is this lucky draw I will take a coupon
randomly it will contain a number from one to ten so to stimulate that I will use the function
from random package it is random dot randint what is this functionality done What is this do
You are supposed to pass two parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ as it is shown so a number form a to b
between that in that range some number will be there so I want from one to ten so one to ten
here both one and ten both the end points are also included any number can be picked from
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one of these ten numbers could be picked
even I have to bet something from one to ten so let me make this statement more clear your
bet from one to ten let me make this more clearer so I have inputted a value I have asked for
what is my bet as you could see here I have asked for his betting so let me find so I have
inputted what is the number on which I want to bet and now I am stimulating this lucky draw
so here I will be getting another number and if so for that before that I need to have
something called the account right Where do I deposit the money that I am winning so let me
say I have some account initially there is nothing I got it from the organisers of the game so it
is zero and now if I get lucky that is my betted number as well as the one I got in the lucky
dry they both turn out to be equal so this double equal to symbol is what I am using it for
equality check if you use a single equal to it is assignment so it will change the value sign but
I want to check the equality I don’t want to change the values so I am using the double equal
to symbol that is equal to the lucky draw then to my accounts what happens Whatever was
there earlier along with that amount say nine hundred rupees gets added and to play this game
how much have I spent Hundred rupees so I have to deduct hundred because I have spent
hundred from my hand and I have added some nine hundred rupees because I have won in
this place so nine hundred got added and I had spent hundred rupees so the net gain is eight
hundred rupees I am getting into my account if I get lucky what if I didn’t get lucky Nothing
I just lose my hundred rupees else if I didn’t get lucky else what happens I will lose hundred
rupees so let me say account is nothing but I have to deduct hundred from my previous
earnings from those earnings I am spending so I have to deduct it ok so at the end of the game
what is there in my account and print ok see I just playing once here I get an input I bet on
some number and some lucky draw happens some number is drawn at random and if that is
equal to what I have bet I win nine hundred rupees else I don’t win anything but to play this
game I have to pay hundred rupees that is why I am deducting hundred in both the cases so at
the end of the game what is that I will have in my account that is after playing this game what
do I have let us see that now let me save this and now let me maximise the console so here is
where you get the output right so let me maximise this portion and now let me run this run
run it ok your bet from one to ten it is asking me let me say I bet on seven minus hundred see
so I had lost why have I lost actually I don’t know I want to see what happened in my lucky
draw case so let me print it and modify this programs slightly let me print the lucky draw
print the lucky draw whatever is the value in lucky draw I want to print it as well as whatever
is in my account I will print it let me save the program and now let me maximise this portion
maximise here and now let me run it again its asking me for a bet so let me now bet on five it
turned out to be four and so I lose ok let me try again I run again this time let me bet on two it
turned out to be ten again I lose I am losing continuously ok it’s all luck so let me try
simulating this multiple times and see what happens let us see this in the next video Hello
guys in the last video you had seen what happens when you try betting on what would appear
as a result of a lottery draw we got a lot of losses but we has just run only once right what if
we play multiple times there is a possibility that we get lucky and we win a lot of price let us
see that so let me assume in the first go if I play this game for one week and here if you see
one week is seven days so seven times I have to get the input its slightly time consuming and
also irritating on the users and if you think seven times you are entering the input so let me
simulate this is just the simulation right so this is we need not accurately do what we do in the
real world so let us make it even this as a random integer that is how we have a lucky draw
something like that we will have a random pick let me copy this and use the same thing here
for betting thing also because every time while giving the input I didn’t have anything in my
mind so I was just randomly giving some input right so let why do I want to get the input let
me pick something randomly so let me pick random so I will use the same thing so see bet I
have random integer and I lucky draw I have something so now I have to print it very clearly
initially I just had lucky draw as a random randomly pick numbers so Ihad just printed the
value but now given that both the values are randomly pick I have to print it properly so let
me print it let me say this is my bet turned out to be bet turned out to be this value that is
stored in the variable bet and now the lucky draw lucky draw this turned out to be the value
stored in this variable lucky underscore draw ok so I will print this too and my account has
zero and every time I will check it I will see if my bet and the lucky draw is equivalent if it is
equal I win a lot of price otherwise I lose so let me here even here I have to say amount in
your account let me say amount in your game account game account is nothing but it is stored
in the variable account may be let me maximise this part so that it’s very clear ok so I have
modified slightly if you could see I will just summarise the modifications so bet I am just
choosing random integer which is my bet which is simulating my bet and this is another
random integer which simulates the lucky draw that is whatever the organiser is picking from
the collections of coupons that is the lucky draw and I will print the values whatever has been
randomly picked then I have my account initially it is zero but as you keep playing see
because we have to repeat this thing as I have said let us see what happens if we play this
game for a week so we have to repeat this thing so if I put zero here account equal to zero
here every time account will be initialised to zero and you cannot really see whether you
actually win or lose so actually when I putted in the loop this must be out of the loop so let
me cut this line from here cut and let me put it here initially my account has nothing the game
account has nothing and I start my game here and I pick a bet and the organiser picks a lucky
draw and if they are both are equivalent I will win some amount if not I don’t win any
amount but since I am paying hundred rupees to play this game once I am subtracting
hundred in both the cases and at the end of the game I will say this is the amount I have in my
account currently so given the this is just seven times we are going to repeat it I said we are
going to simulate it over a week alright so week has seven days so let me going to simulate it
just for seven days seven times so I can print the amount at every instance but if we increase
the number of iterations we may get messy that you print the amount at every instance so that
time what you do what is the final amount after those many number of games have been
played we will just print the final one that’s it ok so I have to repeat this for some seven times
so let me use a far loop any loop can be used for is slightly convenient for us that’s why we
are using it I in range seven because we want to repeat it seven times and see for loop
requires indentation so let me select this entire block so I want this things to be indented so I
have indented I have used a tap key I have indented everything so fine so I am repeating this
seven times right so my programme is done I will just quickly summarise and we will run and
see what happens so initially there is zero in my game account there is nothing in my game
account I am doing this I am playing this game for seven days that is for a week I am playing
this game each day what I do I bet for one number and the organiser will draw will draw a
number randomly from his set of coupons that is what we call as a lucky draw if my betting
and the lucky draw that the organiser has taken if they both are equal I win a prize money if
they both are equal I win a prize money otherwise I don’t win anything but to play this game
I have to pay hundred rupees that is why I am deducting hundred from both the cases and
after each game I am printing what is the amount in my game account so this is what the
programming is doing I have saved it now let me maximise this portion value will get the
output and let me run it run the file see we have got the output maybe I will maximise this
pane that will be clearer so let me maximise this pane see initially the bet was three and lucky
draw was six so I lost here so my account has minus hundred because I had paid hundred
rupees initially and I didn’t win anything so I had minus hundred and see next time bet and
my lucky draw is equal so I got lucky I got an amount next time I lost so some loss is there
next time I had lost so again there is a loss again a loss again a loss again a loss you could see
there are some more losses compare to gain but still due to the ratio of the amount we could
see there is some profit net profit I have out of the game this is we have just simulated the
playing of the game for one week let me just try running again so run again I am getting some
amount oh I am getting still more amount I am having more wins again this time I am losing
this time I am winning so wins and loss it’s all completely random right so anything can
happen so this is I have simulated if I play the game for one week next we will see what
happens if we play the game for one month we will see that in the next video Alright guys in
the previous videos you had seen a simulation of lottery game if we play once and the next
we saw if we play it for one week continuously now let us see if we play it for one months
On an average I take different months have different number of days on an average let me
take thirty days so for thirty days I am playing it so just a simple change in place of seven I
will make it thirty an thirty outputs it difficult to analyse so let me not print everything as I
had done I hope you understood how things work the same thing it will work but given that
the number of iteration the number of times we are repeating is increasing so output may look
slightly messier so let me command these lines so I am commanding so I may need not print
every time what happens I will just what I will do I will just print what is the amount at the
end of the thirty times right I don’t even want to print after every iterations so let me bring
this out of the loop I will remove this indentation let me bring this out of the loops now this is
out of the loop I have simulated this for thirty times I may win or I may lose something may
happen but let me see what is the amount after I have played for thirty times that is after I
have played for one month completely what is the amount whether I have a net profit or a net
loss let us see so let me save the file now let me this is where you get your output right so let
me let me maximise this and ok let me maximise this better and now let me run the file
amount in your account minus three hundred so here I have an net loss this time this month so
if I repeat this time I won this time I have a huge loss compare to minus three hundred minus
two thousand hundred is really huge loss now I won I won something but the winning is less I
won I have a loss I have a loss there is lot of alteration of winning and losing then we cannot
actually predict we win or loss but it seems the losses if we occur is we incur is very huge so
let us try increasing the number of iterations that is we tried for one month right for thirty
iterations let us try it for one year what happens if we play this game for one year and let us
see that in the next video Alright guys so till now you had seen the lottery simulation game
for if we play this game for once one week one month we had seen now let us expand and
let us see what happens if we play this game for one year Nothing just a simple change in the
program in place of thirty thirty days in a month right so I play each day so I had simulated
thirty in place of thirty what if I play for one year so one year it may have three sixty five or
three sixty six days depends on if it is a leap year or not let me consider the current year two
thousand eighteen it’s a non leap year so it will have three sixty five days so I will put three
sixty five you can even try for three sixty six I don’t think much change in result will be there
just one iteration one more time you will play extra I don’t think much change in results will
be there let us plot let us look at whether we could win or we losing let us see so let me
maximise this pin now let me run the file oh it’s a heavy loss I am losing some twelve
thousand rupees oh my god seven thousand rupees I am losing loss loss win loss loss thirty
thousand still heavy loss loss loss win loss you could see I have more loss compare to win so
if you keep playing for one year I was able to find there is more loss compare to win so I am
having the net amount but still you have a idea that there is a loss but we want to visualise
what happens so let us see the visualisation part in the next video
Alright guys so you had seen what happens if you play this game lottery game for one year
continuously so let us visualise what happens rather than seeing the net profit or a net loss let
us visualise it So let me say I will by visualisation I mean let us plot a graph basically graph
with x-axis and y-axis x-axis be on which day what do you win or what do you lose on day
one what is the amount you have on your account on day two what is the amount you have in
your account let us plot that and let us observe the trends so to plot will have a package that is
amt plot lib I hope you had used the same package I guess it is in your crowd computing
experiment the jelly beans experiment I had I hope you had used this package let’s just reuse
the same package will import it import matplotlib dot pyplot the name is very big and even
that we need to use it lot of times difficult for us to type this big name so let us use a shorter
name and alias name to use that you will have key word as you have to say as and use your
shorter name so let me say plt so instead of telling matplotlib dot polyglot I will be telling plt
this is an instruction this is what this means so I have imported it and now I need to plot it
right so I need x-axis and y-axis so I need two lists ‘x’ denotes the ‘x’ axis quantity and let y
denote the ‘y’ axis quantity so on being of each day I have to increase one value in my ‘x’
axis at day one day two day three something like that so at the beginning of the loop I will
add that to my ‘x’ list ‘x’ dot append is the functionality to add some element into your list so
what should I have It is the first day means I have to add one second day two third day three
something like that but you’re for loop is starts counting from zero that you want given that
this is a visualisation for humans we need the counting to start from one so how can we tackle
it just add one to it and append it so if I is zero I want one I is one I want two so I basically
want the values of I plus one let me append it I plus one ok so I have the day has started I bet
something organiser draw something if it is equal I win some amount else I don’t win
anything but to play this game given by that I am paying hundred rupees I am deducting
hundred from each instance and after the game what should I do I have to whatever the
amount I have in my game account I have to append this to my ‘y’ axis that is I have to plot
the corresponding thing in my ‘y’ axis so let me append that to the y axis list so that is y dot
append I have to add it to the list the account account has some amount right so let me say I
have to append this value I have done that at the end of three sixty five days what will be
there in this x list the corresponding day count day one day two day three up to day three
sixty five and in y axis the list have whatever the amount your account contain the particular
day that will be available and I want to plot it this is the net profit or net loss you have and
after that you have to plot it so what should I say plt dot plot this is the function plot it I can
say x and y I want to plot these two things and I want to show the plot so I will say plt dot
show plt dot show so it will plot the values with taking the days in x axis we had set and the
amount in y axis and it will generate a plot and show us the plot this is what these two lines
are doing let us observe visually what happens with these days let us save the program now
let me maximise this side let me maximise the pane maximise the current pane and now let
me run the file see so there are sometimes you have increase in your account sometimes you
have a money but there is a huge fall if you could see see this is really a very huge fall so
you as you keep playing you encounter more a loss if you could see this if you analyse the
fall is very huge so that is what makes it a that is why they say lottery don’t work ok this is
just once let us try again say see even here you could see there is a loss at the end loss and
every time you just observe the y axis the amount positive values are very less negatives are
very high especially observe this particular graph just zero to thousand is the maximum you
had gain but loss some six thousand something some days you has even had such a heavy
loss so that is why the take home message from this is lottery doesn’t work it amount they say
you pay hundred if you win nine hundred nine times of what you pay this is a tempting
statement but if you analyse the interfaces its not that you will win they are actually cheating
you tempting you to lose a lot so it mostly the case that you will lose that is the take home
message from this programming screen cast we had simulated and we had seen and for those
who are interested the next avenue would be there is some probability involved here you
could look into the map of it why is that happening Why is that you lose a lot of time So if
you would analyse the probability of winning and probability of loosing you can get some
insides for those who are interested you can check the math behind it why is it that most of
the times we lose I run once more this time I won I run once more this time there is a loss
again loss loss see there is a lot of loss and win I had run some probably six times just once I
had won that is by one I say I have a net profit most of the times net profit or loss what I gain
out of the game is a loss why this happens You can Del deep into the probability aspects
mathematical aspects that can be done as an extension to what you have learn in the
programming screen cast this you had simulated and shown that it will be a loss why that
happens that is being explained by the mathematical part you can look into it alright guys
thanks for watching this programming screen cast have a nice day
What is the first thing that you do after clicking pictures Of course apply filters in order to
enhance them so let us now shift gears and explore a new technique to enhance images
through our next joy image processing
We see CCTV’s and surveillance cameras almost everywhere these days so do you have any
clue what exactly they do They record a whole lot of photo frames and that becomes a video
and they have to store all these video transactions across several days so storage can be a
problem and hence the video quality is very very less if you want if you want to store one
weeks happenings in your hard disc then the quality will be very less the quality is high you
can only store one days worth transactions so the point is images captured by the surveillance
cameras are generally very very low in quality so low that whenever there is a crime it might
even be difficult for you to detect by surveillance cameras some of the minute details but you
can indeed use your expertise in programming to take those video frames analysing video can
be difficult so let us limit our discussion to photos so assume you capture a picture and the
picture is of low quality so low that you have no clue what exactly are the minute details in
the picture for example you are probably seeing me if you take a picture of mine you
probably wouldn’t know what exactly is this symbol here on my shirt right can you use
programming to enhance an image so much so that the lesser details get enhanced and are
visible as you can see such a enhancement would be a great use for forensic experts
especially in a situations where there is crime and you have captured some pictures let’s say
through surveillance cameras and the qualities very low How do you enhance them Let us
see a couple of situations and let us tell you we are gonna tell you how exactly to enhance the
images so much so that picture make much much better sense then what it did previously
Hello all welcome to programming screen cast of image processing let us explore some cool
ideas in image processing through this screen cast before taking you to the programming part
let me show you the images using which we are going to do image processing This is the
first image as you could see it looks like some mirror image all that we can make out from
this image is just that some news paper clipping some photos have been pasted on the wall
and what is written in the newspaper It’s not so clear this being mirror image it’s not so clear
for person to understand what is being written here so let us apply some image processing
technique transform this image into a form that all can understand and let us try to see what
is there This is our first image for image processing that we are going to do now next image
is this this image has been taken from a crime location as said in lectures then this whole
exercise of image processing is ended helping find out the truth this thing is image of bullet
shot a few bullet shots can be seen but there are many feature in this image which are not
clear to us we will apply some image enhancement techniques image processing techniques
some enhancement technique will enhance this image so that we shall understand about the
minute features present in this image who knows maybe that may serve as evidence let see
ok not we start off with the programming component the first shown is the image of the
mirror image that needs to be flipped so we can understand what is the written in those news
paper clipping that has been pasted on to the wall let us see that so that exercise we are doing
now the technique we are going to apply is flipping in some term it is flipping the image that
is our first image processing task we are going to do for doing this we need to downloads the
necessary package let us do that we need the image package for pil library let me import that
from pil import image done importing alright I had shown you this image this image is
obtained dot png the name is obtain dot png lets open this image it is done by this way image
equals to image dot open here you are suppose to give the file path my image file is in the
same directory as that of my python script so I am just giving the file name in case your
image file is in different path you need to specify the entire path please note that the correct
path has to be specified else if you just specify the name the file would be searched in the
default directory where your script is running please note this point File name is obtained dot
png run with it we have opened this images this part is opening the image we are done with it
images in general computers processes them in terms of matrices so that image is opened the
corresponding matrix format is taken and capture by this object img the matrix format is
capture here and flipping the image is the terminology that we are using here to actually
convert the mirror image into actual image we are using the terminology for the thing that is
easy on our minds but the technical terminology that they uses transposing as I said that
images are generally transferred in terms of matrices so matrices I hope al would have come
across them in your high school level mathematics in matrices there is some special operation
called transposing that is nothing but your making your all rows as columns and columns as
rows that is what you call it as transposing So transposing operations your are going to apply
to this matrix which will actually give you back your actual image from your mirror image
that is what we are going to apply now How will we do that Let’s see this is our matrix
object of the transposed image so let me call this transpose img this is nothing but image img
dot transpose this is the pre defined function transpose of this is the pre defined parameter
image dot flip left right this is the pre defied parameter what this line does is It takes the
matrix that is captured by img of object transposes that matrix and this new matrix is stored
in transpose img object that object captures the new matrix so now we have got the actual
image in the matrix representation that is understandable by the computers but now what we
need to do is We need to convert it into a form that is understandable by humans let’s do that
The next step is we have to convert it into a human understandable format and save it to a file
to a file in a human understandable format that is the next step we need to do alright so this is
done like this transposed image you take the matrix object which you need to actually save it
into human readable format to take this object and call save function on it this is also a pre
defined function and it takes an argument here same like how you had done in open you are
supposed to specify the path where you want your output file to be saved here I want the file
to be saved in the same directory so I just giving the desired file name In case you want it to
be saved in the different path please do specify the entire path correctly and give the desired
file name let me give the desired file name I will call this corrected because that was a mirror
image which was not very clear to us this has been corrected so that it is clear to us now
corrected dot png corrected dot png is the file format I want the same as input file format its
fine with me so I have given that in case you need may be you can try changing the file
format as you required jpg or dmp whatever you can give tat ok so now where everything is
done just print a message this is for us to understand that the output file is ready just say that
done flipping done flipping ok everything is done let me run this file I have given command
as well for each line of the code so in case you think that you need to understand the code
please do pause the video read through that understand the code then you may proceed with
running of the file let me run this file Ok I got the output as done flipping let me check the
output file I had named it as corrected dot png let me check it corrected dot png yeah I got
this yeah this is the file see now it is clear from us to understand what is being written some
news paper clipping doctor accused of killing wife something like this yeah some news paper
clippings have been there so now I can understand what is being written here unlike the
previous image which was not clear to us you can observe side by side this is not very clear
this image is not very clear to us where as after applying the transposing operation we got an
image that is very clear for us to understand what is being conveyed here so this is how
transposing operation has helped us underwhelm something which is which was previously
not clear and now that clear with the help of coding computing well among two operations
that I have said one operation is done let us go with the second operation I don’t want this
thing so let me command it I am done with the first operation so let me command that now
the second operation is nothing but image enhancement there are many image enhancement
techniques available we are going to use one special technique called as histogram
equalisation specifically adaptive histogram equalisation we call it as clahe this is just the
technical name all that you can take is that is an image enhancement technique we are going
to use it so that I had shown you that image previously yeah this is the image there are some
features in this image which are not very clear to us that could be taken clearance we apply
this technique enhance this image so that the portions that are not clearly visible will be
clearly visible who knows this is a image taken from this is the image of bullet shot this is
taken from the crime location there maybe some features which may be evidences which
open up new facts anything can be possible right! Let’s explore alright For doing this we
need to import our package cv2 cv2 is the package we need we have imported and now I
need to same like that I
need to read the image image img equals to cv2 dot image read is the parameter I am
supposed to give similar to the previous one suppose to give the file path here since my
image file path is there in the same directory I am just giving the file name in case your
image file is in a different place you need to specify the path completely file name was crime
dot png let me read this image so image has been read so we are suppose to now apply the
technique CLAHE image enhancement using clahe that is contrast limited adaptive histogram
equalisation it is clahe in case you are interested to learn more about it there are so many
good articles available online which reveal you everything right from the math underlying in
the concept everything’s beautifully explained you can see it here our aim is to arrival the
mystery so we are not getting it into the technical part of it this can be looked up on any time
it’s there are lot of resources available straight forward you can do it so let us apply the
technique to our rescue to unravel new facts who knows anything may unravel let’s see I
have to first prepare for applying clahe technique preparation for clahe this is the step that
has to be done this is the equalisation technique histogram equalisation technique this is an
enhancement technique to enhance the image some preparatory thing has to be done that is
what I am doing now I am creating an object that will how the properties of enhancement
cv2 dot create clahe this is the preparatory face we are done with it now this enhancement
technique works well if the images is in the black and white format all that we need is to
unravel the facts so let us convert it to black and white formats get to know if there are some
new facts and based on that if needed we can even convert it back to colour and we can do it
that is our need basis we can do it anytime so let us convert it to nothing but a gray scale
image so convert it into gray scale image this is the gray scale image we have to convert the
image into the gray scale value so that this enhancement technique shall be really really
effectively applied which converted gray image is equal to cv2 dot cvtcolour of to pass this
image object then colour underscore BGR2GRAY this has been converted into a gray scale
image cvt sorry cv this all these are pre defined functionality in cv2 package so just observe
everything has been pre defined so it is with very few lines of code anyone can enhance any
image unravel any facts from it this is so simple now a day’s ok we are done with making it
into a gray scale image now let is ok we shall apply the enhancement process apply
enhancement that is the next step we have to do enhanced image is clahe dot apply of gray
scale image we are suppose to give the gray scale image to the CLAHE algorithm gray scale
image has been passed and after enhancement all these as I have said image processing all
this would be delt in terms of matrices img is an matrix corresponding to your original image
that has been converted to gray scale and the corresponding matrix is captured by gray Img
and that has been applied and some transformation would occur so the image is enhanced and
this particular matrix is captured by e and h image that is enhanced image this is the short
form I am using it this is captured by this particular object so having said that enhancement is
done it is in a format that is understandable by computers now the next step is to make it
human understandable let’s do that and the output has to be saved in a file save it to a file this
is the next step we are supposed to do will do that cv2 dot im right image right here u s
always we are supposed to give the path of the file but I want the output file also to be written
on to the same directory so I am just giving the desired name in case you want it in a
different path please do specify the complete path I would like to call this as enhance dot png
I am ok with the same format in case you want to change the format you can try for changing
that too and this image must be an image corresponding to this particular matrix this
particular matrix enhanced image the enhanced one from matrix representation which is
understandable by computers to representation that is understandable by humans as to be
written so we have to pass this as well and this particular file be named as enhanced dot png
that is the command we are done with it so once everything is saved to notify us let us print
done enhancing I would recommend that please pause the video here take a look at the code I
have written with comments please do look at the code understand this once you have
understood this completely lets go with running of the code ok now let’s run the code yeah so
it is done done enhancing it shows so let us search for this file enhanced dot png enhanced
dot png let us open this ok this is the given file which was not very clear now just observe
this is enhanced version of the image the cracks on the wall starting from that every minute
detail can be observed it seems some marking is over here even that could be observed alright
now we have enhanced this image few more details that are not clearly visible in that original
image are now revealed after this enhancement we shall analyse this and this may open up
new facts that were earlier un realised thank you for watching this screen cast have a nice day
You see many a times when we take our own picture we realise we actually appear better then
what we are that is because of the inbuilt image processing applications on your cell phone or
on your camera so this is a very bid industry as you know look at instagram it takes your
picture and shows you ten different ways in which you can sort of enhanced right So just
now we showed you a couple of examples of how you can take an image see it as a matrix
and perform operations on it and get a brand new picture out of it right This was just the
beginning it’s a big ocean out there you can actually explore to whatever extent you want
List slit lift filt eat tea what is common among all these Let us find out in our forth coming
joy named anagrams
Do you know what is Hooke’s law Well Hooke’s law states that force needed to extend or
compresses spring by some distance is proportional to that distance it was discovered by
Robert hook Well in earlier time’s scientist were more concern about protecting their secrets
than sharing new knowledge with the world Robert Hooke first reported Hooke’s law has
this which unscrambled to this which means force proportional to stretch you must be
wondering why are we discussing all these well look at these two words these are called
anagrams anagram is a word or a phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word
let me give you some more examples of anagram For example listen silent tar rat dusty
study inch chin brag grab stressed desserts so now let us move towards the programming
screen cast of anagrams
Before we move to the programming screen cast of anagrams I like to tell you what are ascii
values ascii is basically A S C I I which stands for American standard code for information
interchange ascii values basically represent character encoding What do you mean by
character encoding here For example ASCII value of A is sixty five that means a character
represented by some integer value here integer sixty five represents character A Similarly
we have ascii values for rest of the characters too I will show you here we have the ASCII
table you can see here that the capital A is represented by sixty five capital B is represented
by sixty six capital c sixty seven capital d sixty eight which goes till capital z ninety so
similarly we have character encoding for this smaller for the lower case letters too for
example small a is represented by ninety seven small b is represented by ninety eight which
goes till one twenty two and z is represented by one twenty two similarly for the special
symbols also we have the ASCII values for examples exclamation mark is represented by
thirty three then hash value is thirty five then dollar sign is represented by thirty six percent
sign is represented by thirty seven similarly we have ASCII values for plus minus even round
braces so you can see and you can refer this tables for ASCII values and we will be using
these ASCII values for the implementation for our program related to anagrams so let us
move towards the programming screen cast of anagrams
Welcome to the programming screen cast of anagrams I hope you know what are ASCII
values I have explained in the previous video if you haven’t watch the previous video please
go through the previous video ASCII values basically represent character encoding each
character is represented by some integer value ASCII basically stands for American standard
code for information interchange this has already been exchanged in the previous video so
please go through it now the questions comes how can we find the ascii values in python
How can we find the ASCII values of characters in python So we have a pre defined function
here called ord ord we have a pre defined function here will be using this to find the ascii
value of a particular character so I will just show you for example I need to find the ascii
value of capital A so I will just write capital A we have sixty five as I already told you the
ascii value of capital a is sixty five of b is sixty six of c is sixty seven so we will just cross
check whether it is giving us the right ascii values so here it is sixty six then capital c we have
sixty seven now I will check the value of capital z which is basically ninety yes it is ninety
now we can also check the ascii values of lower case letters so I will just write small a here it
is ninety seven that is correct then small b it is ninety eight small c ninety nine and let us also
check the ascii value of small z and it is one twenty two yes we have the ascii values here this
is how you can find the ascii value of a particular character as I already explained we also
have the ascii values for some special symbols like sign of exclamation @ percent hash tag
so we can also check so let us check for the sign of exclamation it is thirty three you can cross
check in the table that we have shown here in the previous video you can cross check with the
particular table now we have let us check for @ it is sixty four and for percent sign it is thirty
seven for dollar it is thirty six for hash tag it is thirty five so this is how you can find the ascii
values of a particular character and some special symbols too so I will advise you to cross
check with the table that we have given in the previous video so now let us use this let us use
this function to implement anagrams so as you know we have two strings and we need to find
whether these two strings are anagram or not So I will take two strings here I will take str1
and I will input enter the first string I will also take the another string str2 and I will write the
input enter the second string second string as you all know by default it takes string as the
input we don’t need to type cast is as we do in the case of integer or decimal values whenever
you have to take string as an input you don’t need to type cast it you just write the input
function input and in the round basis whatever message you want to display so here we are
done we have the str1 and str2 we will compare this str1 and compare the str2 and find out
whether these two strings are anagrams or not so let us think about it if we have to use the
ascii values how can we use it some of the ascii values use of characters present in the
anagrams should be same please think about it the some of the ascii values of the characters
present in anagrams should be same because both the strings have same set of characters if
two strings are anagrams then they should have the same set of characters for example I
showed you one example cat and rat both of these strings comprise of three letters three
characters R A and T so if we if I sum these values of these both strings the if this if I sum the
ascii value of these both strings the answer should be same of the answer is same then these
two strings are anagrams otherwise they are not so I will just now I will just write the code to
how to sum the ascii values of the characters present in the string so will take count one here
I will initialise it to zero I will take the variable I here we will use while loop here I will run
my loop till the length of string one since we are trying to sum of ascii values of str1 so I will
take this while loop take this length of str1 and what should I write here I should write here
count of one is equal to count of one plus I will use the ord function here str1 of I so we have
the count value here now the count one will store the sum of ascii values of the characters
present in str1 I should increment the I value here so that it traverses whole of str1 then I will
take count two also and this is zero similarly I will apply while loop here too in order to find
the sum of ascii values of str2 I will write length of str2 I will write count two is equal to
count two plus ord function str2 of I should also increment the I value here so now I think we
are done with generating the some of ascii values of both the strings now I will write if count
in one is equal to is equal to count two then I have to print these are anagrams anagrams else
what do I need to print here I need to print these are not anagrams I will write these are not
anagrams so I think we are done with the program what did we do here We took two strings
then we stored the some of the ascii values of the characters present in the both strings in
count one and in count two respectively then we compare count one and count two if they are
equal then these must be anagrams otherwise these are not anagrams so I will just run this so
I will write anagrams dot py I should enter the first string for example I enter listen then I
should enter silent as you know listen and silent these both make anagrams but it is saying
that these are not anagrams I think we did a mistake here yes we haven’t initialise I again
please look at this we haven’t initialise I again we incremented I here so we need to initialise
I again because we are using the same variable in both the loops so it was a mistake here so
please rectify it we need to initialise I here again so let me run it again I will write silent and
listen let us check whether it put yes these are anagrams these are right so let us let me run it
again I will write some example which are not anagrams so I
will write for example wet I will write rat these are not anagrams so our programme is giving
us the right output so let me also show you what a count one and count two are storing here
so you get to know that these are actually the same values count one here and I also print
count two here so let us run again so let us take the strings which are anagrams so I will write
rat then I will write tar so see these both count one is also three twenty seven count two is
also three twenty seven so both are anagrams this should be same and our program is giving
us the output these are anagrams since these we already know that these are anagrams so it is
giving us the right output so this is how you can code for anagrams I will go through the
program again First of all we should take two strings str1 and str2 and our motive is to figure
out whether these two strings are anagrams or not so I will just take one count that is the
count one it will store the ascii values sum of the ascii values of the characters present in the
str1 I initialise the I is equal to zero then I had then I will have the while loop which will run
till length of str1 and then we are storing the sum in count one and we are using the ord
function to find the ascii values it will store the sum of the ascii values of the characters
present in the str1 and then we are incrementing I here and I am printing the some of the ascii
values here of str1 then we are initialising another variable that is count two which will store
the sum of ascii values of the characters of str2 and then we also have I is equal to zero why
do we need to do this because we have already incremented in the previous loop and we are
using the same and we are using the same variable here so we need to initialise it again so I
initialise it again so I wrote I is equal to zero then I again had a while loop which will count
the number the sum of ascii values present in str2 and then I printed these count two value
and then I checked if count one is equal to is equal to count two if these both are equal then
these are anagrams otherwise these are not anagrams so I hope you understood the logic
behind it what is the logic behind it If two strings are anagrams then the sum of the ascii
values of the characters present in the both the strings should be same this is self evident as I
showed you we have different examples here silent listen tar rat and in silent and listen the set
of characters present in the str1 and str2 they are same the ascii values should also be same so
that’s why we took the sum of all these ascii values and checked whether these two are equal
if these are equal then the strings are anagrams otherwise they are not anagrams well there are
many other ways in which with which you can find out whether two strings are anagrams or
not! We like you to discuss on discussion form the other ways of how to find how to figure
out whether two strings are anagrams or not in the fourth coming screen cast I will be telling
you one more way through which you can figure out whether two strings are anagrams are
not Thank you
Welcome again to the programming screen cast of anagrams in this particular programming
screen cast I will be discussing another way to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or
not In the previous programming screen cast we have already discussed a way to figure out
whether two strings are anagrams or not in this particular programming screen cast I will be
discussing another way this particular method requires the use of sorted function So what is
sorted function Sorted basically sorts any sequence list for example list and returns the sorted
list so I will show you how can you use the sorted function for example I have a list here
named x of integer values and the values present in this is not sorted for example they are
four three one two now if I write print sorted of x see it printed the sorted value and it printed
the sorted values in ascending order so sorted function basically returns the sorted values in
ascending order I repeat sorted function by default sorts the value present in the list in
ascending order so id I want to sort the list in descending order what should I do Well we
have a way here how can you do that For example we have sorted x and this will pass
another parameter named reverse and in this I will write true so let us check whether it works
or not yes it works so if I write reverse is equal to true then it will sort the values in
ascending order so I repeat sorted functions sorts the value in ascending order and if I write
reverse is equals to true it will sort the values in descending order this is how you can use the
sorted function you can also use the sorted function on different data types for example we
can use the sorted function on character values too for example I have ‘x’ as the list of
characters as q for example w e r t and y now if I write print sorted of ‘x’ press enter so as
you see it has sorted the values in alphabetical order so first of all we have e then q r t w and
y so if we have list of characters then sort it functions sorts the character in alphabetical order
and you can also use the string in this sorted function let us find out how can you use that for
example x is a string here and we have python x is a string which has the value python here if
I write again print sorted of x and what should it print yes it has sorted the characters of
python in alphabetical order first of all h then n then n o p t and y so now you see you can use
a integer list you can use a character list and you can also use the string and use it in sorted
function to sort the values present in the particular list or string and I hope that you are
already aware of dictionaries we can also use sorted to sort the dictionary so how can you do
that I will take the dictionary here I will again name it as ‘x’ so I will write for example q q
is the key here and one is the value then I will take w w is the key here and two is the value
and then I have e here for example and its value is three and let’s take one more value I will
just write four here and then I will take t here its value is zero so we have a invalid syntax
here let us find out where is the problem so the problem is we didn’t use the curly braces yes
in dictionary we should use the curly braces and in list we use the square the rectangle braces
so we should use the curly braces here and then if I write print sorted or ‘x’ see it is sorted the
values in alphabetical order again first of all we have e then q then t and w so it is sorting the
dictionary values on the basis of keys yes it is sorting the dictionary values on the basis of
keys please note this fact now I have another example here for example I have a list of strings
example I have ccccc bb then a then ddd and I want to sort this list on the basic of the length
of this particular string yes I want to sort this list on the basis of length of particular list so the
output should be first of all since a is the list since a is the string in the smallest length so first
of all a should be printed then bb should be printed then ddd then ccccc should be printed so
how can you do that This is fairly easy you just need to write print sorted capital l and the
key should be length just write length here and I press enter here I have the desired output I
sorted this list of string on the basis of length of the particular string so first of all I have a
here then bb then ddd then ccccc so this is how you can sort this on the basis of length of the
particular string so I hope now sorted function is clear to you guys now I will use the sorted
function in our program in our program to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not
so first of all we should take two strings I will take them str1 and str2 I will just write input
enter the first string then I should write str2 is equal to input enter the second string now you
can figure out what purpose would sorted function would serve what purpose would sorted
function serve here so we can sort this to list str1 and str2 and if the sorted version of these
two list is same if the sorted version of these two list is same then you can say that str1 and
str2 are anagrams otherwise they are not what should I write here If sorted of str1 is equal to
is equal to sorted of str2 then I should print these are anagrams else I should print these are
not anagrams so let us run this program I just save it as anagrams two dot py enter the first
string I will enter listen enter the second string I will enter silent these are anagrams so our
output is correct if I run it again enter the first string hello enter the second string thyui any
random string these are not anagrams so our output is correct so I will also show you whether
the sorted version of these two list are same so I will just print sorted str1 and then print
sorted str2 so now let us try to run this again so I will take another anagram example I will
take tar and I will take rat sorry I typed it as r a y so these are not anagrams but you see the
sorted version are not even same first of all they are a r t then it is a r y now let us check on
the list that our anagrams so I will write rat I will write tar so as you can see the sorted
version of these two lists are same so first of all let us a r t for rat and for tar it is a r t so for
sorted version so these two list is same that’s why these are anagram and we can also take the
example of two lists of not anagrams so I will just write another list for example how and
wow how and wow these are not anagrams since the sorted version of these two list is not
same so you can now figure out how you can now figure out how to check whether two
strings are anagrams are not and I will just go through the program again first of all you need
to input two strings that is fairly simple and then you need to check whether the sorted
version of these two list are same if they are same they are anagrams if they are not same
these are not anagrams so this program of anagrams was fairly easy you just need to apply a
function and there you are you get the answer so we have discussed two ways whether two
strings are anagrams or not there are I think many other ways through which you can figure
out I like you to discuss on discussion form and bring out some most nice ideas to check
whether two strings are anagrams or not I hope this programming screen cast was useful to
you guys if you have any problem any doubt please refer the discussion form we are there to
help Thank you Apart from sleeping working and eating what else do we do in our day to
day life Well my answer would be Face booking So let us try to explore FaceBook with our
next joy FaceBook sentiment analysis
You saw what happened People tend to be putting a whole lot of their life status on facebook
in fact someone who is very active on facebook can actually we revealing more than what he
suppose to reveal in fact just by looking at his status updates you can see when he is on a
high when he is on a general low in mood Facebook is such a happening place but
sometimes I suspect are people active in their real life as they are on facebook What comes
to your mind when I say analyse a given data What is data to begin with So how many times
do I smile in a day How many straights of walk do I take every day What is my salt intake
on an average per day Sugar intake how much junk though I eat how many hours do I sleep
Don’t you think if I get this data for one full year and then analyse it put exactly can one
infer we probably can infer how healthy a life style we are living right This is what you
mean by data analytics analysing the given data If something as simple and straight forward
as number of walking straights you take per day say something about your fitness level
What about the data you update on facebook Your overall activity on facebook do you think
we can infer something from an active facebook user the fact is it’s not something we can
infer a whole lot of things Assume I take all the data that you have shared on facebook from
the past one month status one status two status three status four up to let’s say some
hundred status messages that you have shared from the past one month by observing this
what can I infer For example if my status was something like life isn’t fair as I expected it to
be don’t you think I am sounding slightly negative Right second example assume my status
were to be something like this I am proud of my country I made it sound positive but
irrespective of the tone in which one might talk the very sentence I am proud of my country
gives a positive connotation right Now let us look at the third example et your goals right!
so its a very suggestive one liner neither positive nor negative its neutral correct Do you see
the sentiment of the first sentence being negative second being positive the third being
neutral as and always what are we doing Programming of course I told you three sentences
and even told you and you realised that it was positive negative and neutral Is there any way
we can write a piece of code which does the same without any human intervention what if we
can use computer programs to predict what is the sentiment of a given sentence Of what use
will that be U know where I am getting that I told you I take one month’s data of a person
which comprises of hundred status message yeah he has updated hundred status messages I
take all of them s one s two s three up to s hundred and then I look at the sentiment of these
sentences assume eighty on hundred where negative which means this person is undergoing
some trauma in his life or isn’t in general happy person on the contrary what if ninety
messages out of hundred where full of joy it means this person if too look out for a spouse
you should marry this person right a very happy partner will spread sort of happiness and
happiness as you know is contagious right what amount of this hundred status messages are
positive how many of them are negative And how many of them are neutral Don’t you think
if we ask and answer this question we can say something about this person himself I am
interested in doing the following exercises I want to take all the status messages I have ever
updated on face book ever since I was part of the facebook let’s say from two thousand eight
I think I am there on facebook it’s been more than ten years So what I would like to d o is
download all my status updates and try to analyse all of them by looking at the sentiments of
individual status updates and see which are the months I was more happy then unhappy and
months where I was unhappier than happier times when I was neutral and so on you see you
can ask a lot of questions but hurdle here is how do I download my data which is ten years
old once downloaded how do I measure the sentiments of my status updates this in fact is
very easy to do today in fact you can do it for your won facebook data as well and we are
going to illustrate it for you Point number one we will tell you how to download your
facebook data point number two python to our rescue we will tell you how to use the exact
python api to analyse your face book data
Welcome all to the programming screen cast of facebook sentiment analysis I will be going
step by step and explain you how to do facebook sentiment analysis we will be giving you
background of sentiment analysis and others things too So let us start with the programming
screen cast So first of all what do you have to do in here is first of all you have to download
the facebook data and store it in excel file I will show you how can you download the
facebook data for that you must login to your facebook account so here is my facebook
account I have already logged in here first of all you need to download your facebook data
how can you do that For that you must go to the settings in your profile as you are saying I
will go to the settings here I have your facebook information and as you can see I have a tab
on the left pane your facebook information so clink on that here is my facebook information
here I have download your information you can download your copy of your information to
keep or to transfer to another service so click on that view as you all can see I have my
facebook account information here I have the information In the form of posts photos and
videos comments likes and reactions friends etc etc so first of all you need to create a file
here you can see this button create file click on this as you can see here it is written your file
is being processed we let you know when its complete so it will take some time to create the
file and then you can download your file yes so I have already downloaded my facebook
information I will I will show you here I have my facebook and my user name and you can
see I have all the information in here I have about you I have friends my followers
messages pages payment history everything is stored here so when you will create file here
and download your file you will be your information will be downloaded in the formation of
these folders yes you will be given one zip folder and in that folder you will be given this
information you will be given the information about your friends about your groups likes
reactions messages everything will be there so here is our information what you need to do
next is you need to store this information in an excel file yes so I will just show you for
example I have folder here name post so I will just click here here I have my post other
people post to my timeline and my own post too so I have open this page so here is my post it
is basically your post that means only my posts are shown here these are all the posts that I
have posted on my timeline so what you need to do here is you need to store this post in an
excel file for that I have created an excel file for example here all the post I have stored in an
excel file so you need to do the same thing you need to just copy your post from this html file
and you need to paste this these post in an excel file ok I repeat how can you download your
facebook data first of all you need to go to the settings in your facebook profile in settings
you will be given facebook information you need to click on the facebook information tab on
the left pane after going there you will be asked to download your information here first of all
you need to create file the file on the folder will be created and you will be given a folder
like this you will be given a folder like this here you will be having each and every
information related to your facebook profile information regarding your friends your post
network information so this is how you can download your facebook data for our programme
you need to save this information in an excel file so you pick and y folder for example I
picked post and then I open your post dot html which came like this and I stored these post in
an excel file I just copied these posts and stored it in it in an excel file as you can see these
are all the posts that I have stored here ok so you just save these post in an excel file and save
this file you will be using this file for our programme this is how you download your
facebook information and store it in facebook store it in excel file so first and the foremost
step is you need to download your facebook data and store it in an excel file then what you
need to do is you need to import the pandas library it what purpose does it serve it provides
easy to use data structure for data analysis you will get to know how what are this data
structures eventually in our programming screen cast Then you need to import the nltk
library it is a library which is used to process human language yes it is a library which is
used to process human language what does nltk do here It provides sentiment analysis of
human data so what is sentiment analysis Sentiment analysis involves working out whether
a piece of text is positive negative or neutral for example if I ask you how are you This is a
neutral sentence and if I say I am very very very happy today this Is a positive sentence and if
I say I don’t know where my life is going and I am very sad so this is a negative sentence so
sentiment analysis involves working out a piece of text and figuring out what whether it is
positive negative or neutral so this is sentiment analysis so what will be you doing here is the
file that you have stored the post that you have stored in an excel file will be analysing them
will be analysing them on the basis of sentiment analysis will be analysing your post whether
your post are negative positive or neutral so this is facebook sentiment analysis Then we
will use Vader what is Vader Vader is valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoned yes
Vader it is used for sentiment analysis but it not only tells you whether a piece of text is
positive negative or neutral it also takes into account the intensity of the sentiment yes it also
takes into the account the intensity of the sentiment what do I mean by that For example I
said I am very very happy today that it will also tell me that this sentence is eighty percent
positive or seventy percent positive it will also tell me this the intensity of my sentiment ok
so will be using vader here vader stands for valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoned
it takes into account the intensity of the sentiment too you need to download the vader
lexicon what is the lexicon Lexicon acts as a dictionary here lexicon acts as a dictionary
here and then you need to convert your excel sheet that you have created to data frame with
the help of pandas what is a data frame A data frame is a two dimensional structure in the
form of a table so pandas provides you with the data frame facility as I said pandas provides
you easy to use data structure and data frame is one of them will be using them in one of our
program So this is the step by step guide to our program How can we do facebook sentiment
analysis I know some of the things are not clear here when we will do programming screen
cast everything thing will become clear here so I just revise what we have done till now first
of all we need to download your facebook data you need to login to your facebook account
and then you need to go to settings and download your facebook information there we need to
store your information In an excel file that I have already explained then you need to import
the pandas library it basically provide you easy to use data structure for data analysis then
you need to import nltk library nltk library will help you to process the human language it
will basically help you to analyse the human data it will help you in sentimental analysis of
human data sentiment analysis involves working out whether a piece of text is a positive
negative or neutral I have already given you a example of a positive neutral and negative
sentences then you will not be using only nltk will be using vader too vader also takes into
account the intensity of the sentiment yes then you need to download the vader lexicon
lexicon acts as a dictionary here you also need to convert your excel sheet that you have
created to a data frame what is a data frame Data frame is basically two dimensional
structures in the form of table which is provided by panda’s library so this is it now will be
proceeding to the programming screen cast in the next video Thank you
So now let us start with the programming screen cast of facebook sentiment analysis I hope
you have watched the previous videos if you haven’t I suggest you to watch the previous
videos and start with the program of facebook sentiment analysis and I think you all know
what is sentiment analysis now so what is basically sentiment analysis Sentiment analysis
helps you to figure out whether the piece of text is positive negative or neutral yes facebook
sentiment analysis will help you realise the sentiment analysis of your facebook data so first
of all you need to download your facebook data this tips have already been explained in the
previous video so you first download your facebook data store it in a excel file you
download your facebook data and store it in a excel file will be using this excel file in this
program so as I already explained you first need to import the pandas library so I will just
write import pandas as pd then you also need to import the nltk library which will help you in
sentiment analysis I will write import nltk after that you need to import the vader library so
what do you need to do here is you write from nltk dot sentiment dot vader import sentiment
intensity analyser so you need to import these three libraries pandas nltk and from vader you
need to import sentiment intensity analyser then I asked you to download the vader lexicon
you can download directly from here I will just write the command please pay attention I will
write nltk dot downloader dot download and in bracket you need to write vader underscore
lexicon lexicon basically acts as a dictionary here so you need to also download that for
downloading will lexicon you have a command nltk dot downloader dot download and in
package you need to download you need to write vader underscore lexicon hen I will load
my file here what my file name is data underscore file dot excel sx this is my file name in the
previous videos like in speech recognition you had a doubt that where do we need to store the
file which we are going to use in the program for example in speech recognition we used
audio file all of you had a doubt that where do we need to store that file actually you can
store that file anywhere in your system bottom line is you need to provide proper path to your
file yes you need to provide proper path to your file for example here my data underscore file
is in download so I will give a proper path here the path here is basically users simran setia
that is my user name then in that I have the download folder and in that I have my data file ok
so I hope that is clear to all of you you need to provide a proper path ok you can store your
file any where nut you need to provide proper path in your program so I have loaded my file
that is done it is basically xlsx so I have imported the library I have also downloaded the
vader underscore lexicon and then I have also loaded my data file here and next what you
need to do is you need to read from the excel file so I just write excel is equal to pd I will use
pandas library to read my excel file I will write excel file and in bracket where is y excel file
it has been loaded in the variable file so what this is doing This is reading from the read from
excel I repeat pandas library will help you to it is basically pd dot pandas library will help
you to read from the excel file so will write pd because u have imported pandas as pd I will
write pd dot excel fie and in bracket I write my file variable name that is file here ok so I
have read my excel file with the help of pandas library as I already said pandas provide you
easy to use data structure so will be passing this excel file converting this excel file to data
frame what is a data frame As explained data frame is a two dimensional structure in a form
of a table so data frame will help you to analyse your data easily as you know pandas library
provide you with the facility you can convert your excel file to some other data structure
which are easy to analyse yes so will be converting our excel file to data frames so I just
write dfs is equal to xl dot parse and I will write xl dot sheet underscore names zero here we
are storing our information in the first column so I will write zero here I will just show you
for example in the first column only I have stored all my post information you can see here I
have stored all the information in the first column so I will write zero here so I will write hash
what is this statement doing Parsing the excel sheet to data frame parsing the excel sheet to
data frame next what do you have to do here is you need to update your data frames as per
your requirement for example here I have some blank rows here as you can see I have some
blank rows here I need to delete this blank rows from my data frames so I will just write dfs
is equal to list dfs and in square bracket I will write timeline because that is the name of my
column ok and then I also print the all dfs so what it is basically doing here is it is removing
the row from the data frame I will write it removes the blank rows from the data frame So we
will just run our program here and see how data frames are coming so I will just run so I first
need to store my file I will store facebook dot py so as you can see I have my data in the form
of data frames whatever has been written in the excel file is here because I have converted
that excel file to data frames so we have the data frames here now we have the data frames
next step would be analysing them so we will do sentiment analysis on this data frames so
what will I write here first of all I initialise my sentiment intensity analyser I will write sid is
equal to sentiment intensity analyzer then as you can see in my excel file I have this
information too that when my post was posted for example the particular time and date is
already been is also been return so I need not analyse this information the particular time
information so what will I do here is whenever my whenever this sentiment analyser would
encounter this the timeline information the time information it won’t analyse it it will only
analyse my post ok I repeat here for example I have here Monday march twenty seven twenty
seventeen so this has nothing to do with sentiment analysis so I will just remove this I will
not remove here from the excel file I will just hardcoded in my program so that whenever my
program encounters this particular statement this time information it skips that information
and it doesn’t do sentiment analysis on that information so I will just write here I will store it
in str1 so what is the information it is basically utc plus zero five thirty so it may be different
for your for excel file so you need to check in your excel file if there is such kind of
information you can skip that information because this has nothing to do with the sentiment
analysis so now I will write for data in dfs a is equal to data dot find str1 this particular
command will str1 in my excel file in my data frames and if it it will basically return a
Boolean value here for example if it returns minus one here that means it hasn’t found that
str1 in that particular a for example here I have the data here I have the data and if it
encounter this particular line Monday march twenty seven twenty seventeen and it has
encounter this str1 also here so it won’t return minus one here because it has found that utc
plus five thirty here but it hasn’t found that utc plus five thirty here that means it is an
information that needs to be analysed that we need to analyse the that we need to analyse this
particular information we need to perform sentiment analysis on this particular information so
if it is hasn’t found this str1 that means we need to analyse that particular statement so I will
just write ss is equal to sid dot polarity underscore scores data whatever data it has encounter
now now it need to be analyse we needs to perform sentiment analysis on it so it will print
the data here also print the data and then for k in ss write print k and then ss of k it will
basically print whether the basic information is positive negative or neutral and it will also
print the intensity of the sentiment too I will just run this file then you will get to know what I
am trying to say here so I will just run it let us just run it let us just run this so super we have
all the information here we have all the timeline information here so for example my first
post was this row rohith Sharma wants to read the murder of roger whatever it is and then it
has given the polarity also that it is point two five one negative it is point seven four nine
neutral and it is zero positive and the it is also given some compound information compound
information is aggregate of all the sentiment for example it is negative also neutral also but
the compound information says that it is point minus point six nine that means it is negative
similarly in the fourth coming post too it has return that is zero negative it is point seven two
one neutral and it is point two seven nine positive and it is also given the compound
information since the negative value here is zero and here is positive so the compound
information the compound sentiment is also positive here so it is analyse each and every
information given in the excel file and it is return that whether it is negative neutral positive
and also the compound sentiment that we can figure out from the from this information so I
think now everything is clear to you guys now I will revise the each step here also so first of
all what do you need to do here is you need to import the libraries basically you need to
import three libraries here you need to import pandas you need to import nltk and you also
need to import vader here so I have imported these three libraries then I have downloaded the
vader underscore lexicon you also need to download that and then I need to load the file here
since I have already explained you need to provide proper path to your file you can store your
file anywhere in your system then I read from the excel file after reading from the excel file I
will pass the excel file to data frames yes data frames is the facility that has been provided to
us by the pandas library data frames are basically two dimensional structure in that form of a
table it makes the analysis easy and then I have removed the blank rows that at present in my
excel file so this is how you do it after that I have print I have printed my data frames that
each and every data frame is printed here after that I have initialised my sentiment intensity
analyzer and then I have explained you guys that I have in my excel file I have also the time
information the time at which my post was posted on my timeline so I need not analyze this
information this has no relevance so whenever my program encounters this particular str that
is the time information and then it skips that particular statement and goes to the next
statement so for that I have taken a variable a here whenever in my data str1 is found and if
str1 is found it needs to skip that for example that means if its values is minus one it hasn’t
found that str1 yes I repeat if its value is minus one it hasn’t found that str one so now I need
to analyze that particular statement if A value is minus one that means it hasn’t found that
particular statement that particular time information so I will just analyze that statement for
that I need to write sid dot polarity underscore scores and in bracket you need to supply data
then I have printed that data and then for ‘k’ and ss I have printed the particular ‘k’ ‘k’ will
denote here whether it is negative neutral or positive and ss k will tell you the intensity of the
particular sentiments ‘k’ here is the sentiment ss of ‘k’ here is the intensity of the sentiment I
hope that this programming screen cast was useful to you guys and you have understood it
well and if you have any doubts please post on the discussion form we are there to help you
Thank you thank you so much Guess what Today is my birthday and I got this pack of
letters written anonymously by my friends will now I have to figure out who has written
which letter Can we write a code for this Well let us find out in our next joy natural
language processing
Observe the conversation happening between these two teachers One teacher is getting her
feed back by the students and the other teacher is just listening to whatever this teaching is
saying Let us see the conversation now
Hey anamika! Hey how are you So how is this semester been Semester has been great that’s
also reflected in the favour of forms that I received from the students which are graduating
oh nice and there is one regular form that I like to show you for two reasons ok mostly they
are and second thing is that I have a feeling who would have written this wait a second they
are anonymous feedback right Yeah so how do you know who is written it Yeah yeah they
are anonymous but from the style which they write I am doing that I have checked their
answer sheets from the beginning I have a feeling of the style that they use so this sheet you
see there lot of E usage and lot of adjective so I have a feeling who would have written this
Oh wow
You see what just happened One teacher by name anamika is talking to another teacher
varsha about her feedback as a teacher students have given her some feedback and in that
feedback particularly anamika is impressed with one such students feedback who has given
her a whole lot of complements and most importantly anamika realises that all though the
feedback is anonymous she has feeling who might have written that feedback how She
understands some sort of way it is written the sentence the grammar and the style of writing
in general even that she is a teacher of a classroom she probably knows how her students
write she is trying to figure out who this student could be who has given her complements Is
it really true that we can look at the style of writing and then conclude that this is the person
who has written this letter let us do a small experiment We have this huge repository called
the project Gutenberg all you can do there is download a whole lot of books that are available
in a text format free of cost without out any none of these things are copyrighted material
you can get this material and then analyse the data with your programming skills Now I
would like to take a look at some author’s complete work and try to figure out if we can see
some signatures in their writing
